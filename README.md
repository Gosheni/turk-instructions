# Web-Grounded Natural Language Instructions 

This repository maintains a large collection of tasks and their natural language instructions that are grounded in the visual information. 

Here are two example tasks:

Background 
--- 

**Why define tasks in natural language?** While the current dominant paradigm (supervised learning with task-specific labeled examples) has been 
successful in building task-specific models, such models can't generalize to unseen tasks; for example, a model that is supervised to solve questions 
cannot solve a classification task. We hypothesize that a model equipped with understanding and reasoning with natural language instructions should be able to generalize to any task that can be defined in terms of natural language.

**How is it tied to the past work?** 


**Why collect this data?**
