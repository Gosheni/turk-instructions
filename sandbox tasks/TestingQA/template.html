 In this task, you will be asked to answer five questions, reading Wikipedia articles related to the questions. We first ask you to <b>select a paragraph that answers the
 question</b>, and then ask you to <b>find a minimal answer</b> from the paragraph.
 </p><center>

 <h5>
 <b>
 <font color=blue>Task 1: Select a paragraph that answers the question.
 </font>
 </b>
 </h5>
 First, you read several paragraphs from relevant Wikipedia articles in the left side. <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>If you find a paragraph that answers the
 questions (we call it <b>a gold paragraph</b>), click on the paragraph</span>. As shown in the gif below, once you click on a paragraph, the paragraph will be highlighted in orange. <br>
 Please pay attention to the <b>Wikipedia article titles
 on the top
 of each block</b> -- the paragraph may look plausible, but can be taken from unrelated articles that do not actually answer the question. <br>
 <br>
 <u><span style=background-color:lightblue>Blue</span> paragraphs selected by AI</u><br> The articles is preprocessed and each paragraphs are surrounded by a dashed line.
 <b>To help you to
 quickly annotate, by default we only show paragraphs (highlighted in light blue) which
 our AI predicts are relevant to the question</b>. Note that our AI is not perfect and it may highlight irrelevant paragraphs or overlook paragraphs highly relevant to the question.
 So <i>what should you do when you cannot find the answers in the <span style=background-color:lightblue>blue</span> paragraphs</i>?
 <br>
 <br>
 <center>
 <img src=data:, alt=instruction height=420 width=600 style="border:1px solid black">
 </center>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>Reading more paragraphs &amp; articles</u><br> Our suggestion is <i>please read some
 other articles or paragraphs</i> that our AI may overlook, as you usually do when you try to find an answer by googling!
 <br>If you would like to read a full article, please click on <span style=background-color:lightblue>[show full
 article]</span>, and our interface shows you the whole article including the highlighted ones and non-highlighted ones. You can scroll down to other articles. If you would like to collapse the article you've
 already read, please click on
 <span style=background-color:lightblue>[collapse the article]</span>.
 <br>
 The example below asks "Where does cesium rank in abundance of elements in Earth's crust?". This cannot be answered by the paragraphs originally shown, but you can find a paragraph from the initially collapsed article (Cesium) that answers the question.

 <br>
 If you check more paragraphs from multiple articles but still cannot find the answer, please <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>select
 <b>No gold paragraph</b></span>.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h6><u>FAQ 1: What are <b>gold paragraphs</b>?</u></h6>
 We consider that a paragraph answers a question when the paragraph clearly includes an answer or presents sufficient information / evidence to answer the question. For example, the two paragraphs below are
 <font color=blue><b>are gold paragraphs</b></font>.
 <table class="table table-striped">
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>Question</th>
 <th>Paragraph </th>
 <th>Is <b>Gold</b>?</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>What is the capital city of japan?</td>
 <td>The current capital of Japan is <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>Tokyo</span>. In the course of history, the national capital has been in many locations other than Tokyo.
 </td>
 <td>
 <font color=blue><b>Gold</b></font>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>How many years the American Civil War lasted?</td>
 <td>The American Civil War (also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>from
 1861 to 1865</span>, fought between the northern United States (loyal to the Union) and the southern United States (that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy)</td>
 <td>
 <font color=blue><b>Gold</b></font>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>What did Ron Paul do in college?</td>
 <td>Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician, and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again
 from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013.</td>
 <td>
 <font color=red><b>NOT Gold</b></font>
 </td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
 </table>
 <h6><u>FAQ 2: Oops, I mistakenly clicked on an incorrect one... Can I change the
 selected
 paragraph?</u></h6>
 Of course! Whenever you click on a paragraph, we automatically update the selection, so you just need to click on another paragraph that you think answers the question. If you think none of the paragraphs answer the question, just click on <b>No
 gold paragraph.</b>
 <hr>
 <h5>
 <b>
 <font color=blue>
 Task 2: Select a minimal answer based on the paragraph.
 </font>
 </b>
 </h5>
 If you select a gold paragraph in Task 1, please carefully read the paragraph again, and find a <b>minimal complete answer</b>. A minimal answer means either a
 <b>minimal (shortest) phrase in the paragraph (Task 2-a)</b> or <b>"Yes"/"No"(Task
 2-b)</b> if that's what the question is asking for. <br>
 <br>
 <h6><b>
 <font color=blue>Task 2-a: Select a minimal answer from the paragraph if
 any.</font>
 </b></h6>
 If the question is asking for some specific answer such as a person name, location name or date, <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>select a minimal answer in the
 paragraph</span>. Move your cursor to the paragraph you select as a gold paragraph, click at the starting position and drag your mouse cursor over the portion. <b>You cannot type your own answer in 2-a.</b><br>
 If you think the paragraph answers the question, but there is no minimal answer extractable from the paragraph, or the short answer cannot be determined due to ambiguity in the given question, please leave 2-a empty. Please see FAQ 4 for more information.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h6><b>
 <font color=blue>Task 2-b: Select <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b> if that's what the question asks for.
 </font>
 </b>
 </h6>
 Some questions are asking for "Yes" or "No" (e.g., Is Tokyo the capital city of Japan?). Please <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>select <b>Yes</b> or <b>No
 </b></span> for these questions instead of selecting a minimal answer in the paragraphs.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h6><u>FAQ 3: Can we update the span if we find a better minimal span after we
 select one?</u>
 </h6>
 We automatically update the answer information whenever you re-select the phrase in the paragraph, so you can update your answers as many times as you want.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h6><u>FAQ 4: The paragraph is good but there is no minimal complete answers...</u>
 </h6>
 If you think there is no minimal answer span, you can just leave 2-A empty. However, in our internal experiments, we found that those cases are not substantial in our data. We show several cases that we observe in our data:<br>
 <div class=card>
 <div class=card-body>
 <b>Case 1: there is no minimal phrase that answers the questions.</b><br>
 In this case, the gold paragraph explains the Synopsis of this novel, but does not have any minimal phrases or sentence that completely answers the question.
 <hr>
 <h6><b>Question</b>:<br> What is the story of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duel_(Kuprin_novel) target=_blank>the novel, The Duel?</a></h6>
 <b>Gold paragraph</b>: It concerns an intelligent young officer, Second Lieutenant Romashov, stationed at a dull military garrison in southern Russia where he can not stomach his sadistic and stupid colleagues
 and military life. He falls in love with the wife of a superior officer, a cold and calculating woman whose one ambition is her husband's advancement. The affair leads in the end to the duel of the title, both
 externally, and figuratively through the young man's naive dreams of grandeur confronting the degeneration of military life and society of the time.
 </div>
 </div>
 <div class=card>
 <div class=card-body>
 <b>Case 2: a short answer cannot be determined given the question and the
 gold paragraph.</b><br>
 A short answer to this question cannot be determined due to the ambiguity in the question. The number of the books in the Bible vary across different denominations, and the question does not specify that.
 <hr>
 <h6><b>Question</b>:<br> How many of
 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_the_Bible target=_blank>the books are in the Bible</a>?</h6>
 <b>Gold paragraph</b>: Christian Bibles range from the <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>73</span> books of the Catholic Church canon, the <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>66</span> books of the
 canon of some denominations or the <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>80</span> books of the canon of other denominations of the Protestant Church, to the <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>81</span> books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon. The first part of Christian Bibles is the Greek Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the above <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>24</span> books
 of the Tanakh but divided into <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>39</span> books and ordered differently.

 <h4>Please keep in mind below:</h4>
 <ol>
 <li> <b>Do not select "plausible but incorrect" answers. </b> When you select a minimal short span in a paragraph you select, you might see multiple spans that look plausible based on type-matching.
 <div class=card>
 <div class=card-body>
 <h6><b>Question</b>:<br> When did <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagayaki_Taishi target=_blank>Kagayaki
 Taishi</a> join a sumo stable to start his professional career as a sumo wrestler? </h6>
 <b>Gold paragraph</b>:<br> Tatsu Ryōya (Kagayaki Taishi) first began practicing sumo whilst in
 <font color=red>the first grade of elementary school</font>. <br>
 He gave up formal education <span style=background-color:#FFFF00>at the age
 of fifteen</span> and entered the Takadagawa stable to pursue a professional career.　 <br>
 He was still
 <font color=red>a month away from his sixteenth birthday</font> when he made his professional debut in May 2010.
 <hr>
 <b>Comments</b>: Only the span highlighted yellow is a correct minimal answer, while the two spans shown in red are not correct.
 </div>
 </div>
 <div class=card>
 <div class=card-body>
 <h6><b>Question</b>:<br> when was the first marathon debut of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Gebrselassie target=_blank>Haile
 Gebrselassie?</a></h6>
 <b>paragraph</b>:<br> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tergat target=_blank>Paul Kibii Tergat</a> (born 17 June 1969) is a Kenyan former professional long distance runner. Tergat finished second in his
 first three marathons: London Marathon in
 <font color=red> 2001</font> and 2002 and Chicago Marathon in 2001. He continued marathoning by two fourth places: Chicago 2002 and London 2003.
 <hr>
 <b>Comments</b>: Although the paragraph looks relevant at first glance, the article is actually about different marathon runner. You should not mark this paragraph as a gold paragraph and select 2001 as a minimal answer.
 </div>
 </div>

Ken Saro-Wiwa was a member of the Ogoni people, an ethnic minority in Nigeria whose homeland, Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta, which has been targeted for crude oil extraction since the 1950s and which has suffered extreme environmental damage from decades of indiscriminate petroleum waste dumping. Initially as a spokesperson, and then as the president, of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multinational petroleum industry, especially the Royal Dutch Shell company.

His best known novel, "" (1985), tells the story of a naive village boy recruited to the army during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, and intimates the political corruption and patronage in Nigeria's military regime of the time. His war diaries, "On a Darkling Plain" (1989), document his experience during the war. He was also a successful businessman and television producer.

His sentiments were proven correct in the coming years, as Babangida failed to relinquish power. In 1993, Babangida annulled Nigeria's general elections that would have transferred power to a civilian government, sparking mass civil unrest and eventually forcing him to step down, at least officially, that same year.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>KenSaro-Wiwa-11</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_11-body><p class=card-text id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_11-text>Saro-Wiwa's works include TV, drama and prose writing.

Although the government wanted to carry out the sentences immediately, it had to wait two days for a makeshift gallows to be built. Within hours of the sentences being upheld, nine coffins were taken to the prison, and the following day a team of executioners was flown in from Sokoto to Port Harcourt.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>KenSaro-Wiwa-25</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_25-body><p class=card-text id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_25-text>On 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the rest of the Ogoni Nine were taken from the army base where they were being held to Port Harcourt prison. They were told that they were being moved to Port Harcourt because it was feared that the army base they were being held in might be attacked by Ogoni youths. The prison was heavily guarded by riot police and tanks, and hundreds of people lined the streets in anticipation of the executions. After arriving at Port Harcourt prison, Saro-Wiwa and the others were herded into a single room and their wrists and ankles were shackled. They were then led one by one to the gallows and executed by hanging, with Saro-Wiwa being the first. It took five tries to execute him due to faulty equipment. His last words were: "Lord take my soul, but the struggle continues." After the executions, the bodies were taken to the Port Harcourt Cemetery under armed guard and buried. Anticipating disturbances as a result of the executions, the Nigerian government deployed tens of thousands of troops and riot police to two southern provinces and major oil refineries around the country. The Port Harcourt Cemetery was surrounded by soldiers and tanks.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>KenSaro-Wiwa-26</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_26-body><p class=card-text id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_26-text>The executions provoked a storm of international outrage. The United Nations General Assembly condemned the executions in a resolution which passed by a vote of 101 in favor to 14 against and 47 abstentions. The European Union condemned the executions, which it called a "cruel and callous act", and imposed an arms embargo on Nigeria. The United States recalled its ambassador from Nigeria, imposed an arms embargo on Nigeria, and slapped travel restrictions on members of the Nigerian military regime and their families. The United Kingdom recalled its high commissioner in Nigeria, and British Prime Minister John Major called the executions "judicial murder." South Africa took a primary role in leading international criticism, with President Nelson Mandela urging Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations. Zimbabwe and Kenya also backed Mandela, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe backing Mandela's demand to suspend Nigeria's Commonwealth membership, but a number of other African leaders criticized the suggestion. Nigeria's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations was ultimately suspended, and Nigeria was threatened with expulsion if it did not transition to democracy in two years. The US and British governments also discussed the possibility of an oil embargo backed by a naval blockade of Nigeria.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>KenSaro-Wiwa-27</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_27-body><p class=card-text id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_27-text>In his 1989 short story "Africa Kills Her Sun", Saro-Wiwa in a resigned, melancholic mood, foreshadowed his own execution.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>KenSaro-Wiwa-29</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_29-body><p class=card-text id=KenSaro-Wiwa_paragraph_29-text>The Ken Saro-Wiwa foundation was established in 2017 to work towards improved access to basic resources such as electricity and Internet for entrepreneurs in Port Harcourt.

Its main aim is to restore an independent state of Biafra in the Old Eastern Region of Nigeria, comprising mainly today's South-East and South-South Regions of Nigeria, and also parts of the Middle Belt states of Nigeria such as Benue State and Kogi State, through an independence referendum. The group was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a British Nigerian political activist known for his advocacy of the contemporary Biafran independence movement.

IPOB has criticized the Nigerian federal government for poor investment, political alienation, inequitable resource distribution, ethnic marginalization, and heavy military presence, extra-judicial killings in the South-Eastern, South-Central and parts of North-Central regions of the country. The organization rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and is now the largest Biafran independence organization by membership.

In 1970, the Biafran forces surrendered through the armistice brokered by the defunct OAU.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>IndigenousPeopleofBiafra-4</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=IndigenousPeopleofBiafra_paragraph_4-body><p class=card-text id=IndigenousPeopleofBiafra_paragraph_4-text>The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra is Nnamdi Kanu who is a dual British and Nigerian citizen.

MASSOB accused Uwazuruike of associating himself with "mainstream Nigerian politics" instead of furthering the cause of Biafra. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM's activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization.

Trump's political interests are in line with supporting Biafra, because of oil pursuits.

Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, while Biafra was led by Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu. Biafra represented the nationalist aspirations of the Igbo ethnic group, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the federal government dominated by the interests of the Muslim Hausa-Fulanis of northern Nigeria. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious violence and anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta also played a vital strategic role. Within a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, captured coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. A blockade was imposed as a deliberate policy during the ensuing stalemate which led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2&nbsp;million Biafran civilians died of starvation.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-1</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_1-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_1-text>In mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of Western countries. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a "cause célèbre" in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were the main supporters of the Nigerian government, while France, Israel (after 1968) and some other countries supported Biafra. The United States' official position was one of neutrality, considering Nigeria as 'a responsibility of Britain', but some interpret the refusal to recognize Biafra as favouring the Nigerian government.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-4</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_4-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_4-text>This civil war can be connected to the colonial amalgamation in 1914 of Northern protectorate, Lagos Colony and Southern Nigeria protectorate (later renamed Eastern Nigeria), which was intended for better administration due to the close proximity of these protectorates.

When the colony of Nigeria had been created, its three largest ethnic groups were the Igbo, who formed about 60–70% of the population in the southeast; the Hausa-Fulani of the Sokoto Caliphate, who formed about 67% of the population in the northern part of the territory; and the Yoruba, who formed about 75% of the population in the southwestern part. Although these groups have their own homelands, by the 1960s, the people were dispersed across Nigeria, with all three ethnic groups represented substantially in major cities. When the war broke out in 1967, there were still 5,000 Igbos in Lagos.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-6</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_6-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_6-text>The semi-feudal and Muslim Hausa-Fulani in the North were traditionally ruled by a conservative Islamic hierarchy consisting of emirs who in turn owed their allegiance to a supreme Sultan.

At its zenith, the Kingdom controlled most of Igbo land, including influence on the Anioma people, Arochukwu (which controlled slavery in Igbo), and Onitsha land. Unlike the other two regions, decisions within the Igbo communities were made by a general assembly in which men and women participated.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-9</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_9-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_9-text>The differing political systems and structures reflected and produced divergent customs and values. The Hausa-Fulani commoners, having contact with the political system only through a village head designated by the Emir or one of his subordinates, did not view political leaders as amenable to influence. Political decisions were to be submitted to. As with many other authoritarian religious and political systems, leadership positions were given to persons willing to be subservient and loyal to superiors. A chief function of this political system in this context was to maintain conservative values, which caused many Hausa-Fulani to view economic and social innovation as subversive or sacrilegious.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-10</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_10-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_10-text>In contrast to the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbos and other Biafrans often participated directly in the decisions which affected their lives. They had a lively awareness of the political system and regarded it as an instrument for achieving their personal goals. Status was acquired through the ability to arbitrate disputes that might arise in the village, and through acquiring rather than inheriting wealth. The Igbo had been substantially victimized in the Atlantic slave trade; in the year 1790, it was reported that of 20,000 people sold each year from Bonny, 16,000 were Igbo. With their emphasis upon social achievement and political participation, the Igbo adapted to and challenged colonial rule in innovative ways.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-11</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_11-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_11-text>These tradition-derived differences were perpetuated and perhaps enhanced by the colonial government in Nigeria. In the North, the colonial government found it convenient to rule indirectly through the Emirs, thus perpetuating rather than changing the indigenous authoritarian political system. Christian missionaries were excluded from the North, and the area thus remained virtually closed to European cultural influence. By contrast the richest of the Igbo often sent their sons to British universities, with the intention of preparing them to work with the British. During the ensuing years, the Northern Emirs maintained their traditional political and religious institutions, while reinforcing their social structure. At the time of independence in 1960, the North was by far the most underdeveloped area in Nigeria. It had an English literacy rate of 2%, as compared to 19.2% in the East (literacy in Ajami (local languages in Arabic script), learned in connection with religious education, was much higher). The West also enjoyed a much higher literacy level, as it was the first part of the country to have contact with western education, and established a free primary education program under the pre-independence Western Regional Government.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-12</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_12-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_12-text>In the West, the missionaries rapidly introduced Western forms of education.

However, the Igbo and other Biafran people actively embraced Western education, and they overwhelmingly came to adopt Christianity. Population pressure in the Igbo homeland, combined with aspirations for monetary wages, drove thousands of Igbos to other parts of Nigeria in search of work. By the 1960s, Igbo political culture was more unified and the region relatively prosperous, with tradesmen and literate elites active not just in the traditionally Igbo East, but throughout Nigeria. By 1966, the traditional ethnic and religious differences between Northerners and the Igbo were exacerbated by new differences in education and economic class.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-15</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_15-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_15-text>The colonial administration divided Nigeria into three regions—North, West and East—something which exacerbated the already well-developed economic, political, and social differences among Nigeria's different ethnic groups. The country was divided in such a way that the North had a slightly higher population than the other two regions combined. There were also widespread reports of fraud during Nigeria's first census, and even today population remains a highly political issue in Nigeria. On this basis, the Northern Region was allocated a majority of the seats in the Federal Legislature established by the colonial authorities. Within each of the three regions the dominant ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, respectively formed political parties that were largely regional and based on ethnic allegiances: the Northern People's Congress (NPC) in the North; the Action Group in the West (AG); and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) in the East. Although these parties were not exclusively homogeneous in terms of their ethnic or regional make-up, the disintegration of Nigeria resulted largely from the fact that these parties were primarily based in one region and one tribe.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-16</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_16-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_16-text>The basis of modern Nigeria formed in 1914, when Britain amalgamated the Northern and Southern protectorates. Beginning with the Northern Protectorate, the British implemented a system of indirect rule of which they exerted influence through alliances with local forces. This system worked so well, Colonial Governor Frederick Lugard successfully lobbied to extend it to the Southern Protectorate through amalgamation. In this way, a foreign and hierarchical system of governance was imposed on the Igbos. Intellectuals began to agitate for greater rights and independence. The size of this intellectual class increased significantly in the 1950s, with the massive expansion of the national education program. During the 1940s and 1950s the Igbo and Yoruba parties were in the forefront of the campaign for independence from British rule. Northern leaders, fearful that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more Westernized elites in the South, preferred the continuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority. Igbo and Yoruba leaders, anxious to obtain an independent country at all costs, accepted the Northern demands.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-17</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_17-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_17-text>However, the two Southern regions had significant cultural and ideological differences, leading to discord between the two Southern political parties. Firstly, the AG favored a loose confederacy of regions in the emergent Nigerian nation whereby each region would be in total control of its own distinct territory. The status of Lagos was a sore point for the AG, which did not want Lagos, a Yoruba town situated in Western Nigeria (which was at that time the federal capital and seat of national government) to be designated as the capital of Nigeria, if it meant loss of Yoruba sovereignty. The AG insisted that Lagos must be completely recognized as a Yoruba town without any loss of identity, control or autonomy by the Yoruba. Contrary to this position, the NCNC was anxious to declare Lagos, by virtue of it being the "Federal Capital Territory" as "no man's land"—a declaration which as could be expected angered the AG, which offered to help fund the development of another territory in Nigeria as "Federal Capital Territory" and then threatened secession from Nigeria if it didn't get its way. The threat of secession by the AG was tabled, documented and recorded in numerous constitutional conferences, including the constitutional conference held in London in 1954 with the demand that a right of secession be enshrined in the constitution of the emerging Nigerian nation to allow any part of the emergent nation to opt out of Nigeria, should the need arise. This proposal for inclusion of right of secession by the regions in independent Nigeria by the AG was rejected and resisted by NCNC which vehemently argued for a tightly bound united/unitary structured nation because it viewed the provision of a secession clause as detrimental to the formation of a unitary Nigerian state. In the face of sustained opposition by the NCNC delegates, later joined by the NPC and backed by threats to view maintenance of the inclusion of secession by the AG as treasonable by the British, the AG was forced to renounce its position of inclusion of the right of secession a part of the Nigerian constitution. Had such a provision been made in the Nigerian constitution, later events which led to the Nigerian/Biafran civil war may have been avoided. The pre-independence alliance between the NCNC and the NPC against the aspirations of the AG would later set the tone for political governance of independent Nigeria by the NCNC/NPC and lead to disaster in later years in Nigeria.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-18</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_18-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_18-text>Northern–Southern tension manifested firstly in the 1945 Jos Riot in which 300 Igbo people died and again on 1 May 1953, as fighting in the Northern city of Kano.

Each government was entitled to collect royalties from resources extracted within its area. This changed in 1956 when Shell-BP found large petroleum deposits in the Eastern region. A Commission led by Sir Jeremy Raisman and Ronald Tress determined that resource royalties would now enter a "Distributable Pools Account" with the money split between different parts of government (50% to region of origin, 20% to federal government, 30% to other regions). To ensure continuing influence, the British government promoted unity in the Northern bloc and secessionist sentiments among and within the two Southern regions. The Nigerian government, following independence, promoted discord in the West with the creation of a new Mid-Western Region in an area with oil potential. The new constitution of 1946 also proclaimed that "The entire property in and control of all mineral oils, in, under, or upon any lands, in Nigeria, and of all rivers, streams, and watercourses throughout Nigeria, is and shall be vested in, the Crown."

The Indian historian Pradeep Barua called the Nigerian Army in 1960 "a glorified police force", and even after independence, the Nigerian military retained the role it held under the British in the 1950s. The Nigerian Army did not conduct field training, and notably lacked heavy weapons. Before 1948, Nigerians were not allowed to hold officer's commissions, and only in 1948 were certain promising Nigerian recruits allowed to attend Sandhurst for officer training while at the same time Nigerian NCOs were allowed to become officers if they completed a course in officer training at Mons Hall or Eaton Hall in England. Despite the reforms, only an average of two Nigerians per year were awarded officers' commissions between 1948–55 and only seven per year from 1955 to 1960. At the time of independence in 1960, of the 257 officers commanding the Nigeria Regiment which became the Nigerian Army, only 57 were Nigerians.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-27</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_27-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_27-text>Using the "martial races" theory first developed under the Raj in 19th-century India, the colonial government had decided that peoples from northern Nigeria such as the Hausa, Kiv, and Kanuri were the hard "martial races" whose recruitment was encouraged while the peoples from southern Nigeria such as the Igbos and the Yoruba were viewed as too soft to make for good soldiers and hence their recruitment was discouraged. As a result, by 1958, men from northern Nigeria made up 62% of the Nigeria Regiment while men from the south and the west made up only 36%. In 1958, the policy was changed: henceforward men from the north would make up only 50% of the soldiers while men from the southeast and southwest were each to make up 25%. The new policy was retained after independence. The previously favored northerners whose egos had been stoked by being told by their officers that they were the tough and hardy "martial races" greatly resented the change in recruitment policies, all the more as after independence in 1960 there were opportunities for Nigerian men to serve as officers that had not existed prior to independence. As men from the southeast and southwest were generally much better educated than men from the north, they were much more likely to be promoted to officers in the newly founded Nigerian Army, which provoked further resentment from the northerners. At the same time, as a part of Nigerianisation policy, it was government policy to send home the British officers who had been retained after independence, by promoting as many Nigerians as possible until by 1966 there were no more British officers. As part of the Nigerianisation policy, educational standards for officers were drastically lowered with only a high school diploma being necessary for an officer's commission while at the same time Nigerianisation resulted in an extremely youthful officer corps, full of ambitious men who disliked the Sandhurst graduates who served in the high command as blocking further chances for promotion. A group of Igbo officers formed a conspiracy to overthrow the government, seeing the northern prime minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, as allegedly plundering the oil wealth of the southeast.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-29</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_29-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_29-text>On 15 January 1966, Major Chukuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna, and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted a coup d'état.

Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello's wife and officers of Northern extraction. The President, Sir Nnamdi Azikiwe, an Igbo, was on an extended vacation in the West Indies. He did not return until days after the coup. There was widespread suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters had tipped him and other Igbo leaders off regarding the pending coup. In addition to the killings of the Northern political leaders, the Premier of the Western region, Ladoke Akintola and Yoruba senior military officers were also killed. The coup, also referred to as "The Coup of the Five Majors", has been described in some quarters as Nigeria's only revolutionary coup. This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria's nascent second democracy. Claims of electoral fraud were one of the reasons given by the coup plotters. Besides killing much of Nigeria's elite, the "Majors' Coup" also saw much of the leadership of the Nigerian Federal Army killed with seven officers holding the rank above colonel killed.

The Nigerian Army had no training or experience of war on the operational level, still being primarily an internal security force. Most Nigerian officers were more concerned with their social lives than military training, spending a disproportionate amount of their time on partying, drinking, hunting and playing games. Social status in the Army was extremely important and officers devoted an excessive amount of time to ensure their uniforms were always immaculate while there was a competition to own the most expensive automobiles and homes. The killings and purges perpetuated during the two coups of 1966 had killed most of the Sandhurst graduates. By July 1966, all of the officers holding the rank above colonel had been either killed or discharged while only 5 officers holding the rank of lieutenant colonel were still alive and on duty. Almost all of the junior officers had received their commissions after 1960 and most were heavily dependent on the more experienced NCOs to provide the necessary leadership. The same problems that afflicted the Federal Army also affected the Biafran Army even more whose officer corps was based around former Federal Igbo officers. The shortage of experienced officers was a major problem for the Biafran Army, made worse by a climate of paranoia and suspicion within Biafra as Ojukwu believed that other former Federal officers were plotting against him.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-54</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_54-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_54-text>Shortly after extending its blockade to include oil, the Nigerian government launched a "police action" to retake the secessionist territory.

The Nigerian Army offensive was through the north of Biafra led by Colonel Mohammed Shuwa and the local military units were formed as the 1st Infantry Division. The division was led mostly by northern officers. After facing unexpectedly fierce resistance and high casualties, the western Nigerian column advanced on the town of Nsukka, which fell on 14 July, while the eastern column made for Garkem, which was captured on 12 July.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-56</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_56-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_56-text>The Biafrans responded with an offensive of their own.

Passing through the state capital of Benin City, the Biafrans advanced west until 21 August, when they were stopped at Ore in present-day Ondo State, east of the Nigerian capital of Lagos. The Biafran attack was led by Lt. Col. Banjo, a Yoruba, with the Biafran rank of brigadier. The attack met little resistance and the MidWestern state was easily taken over. This was due to the pre-secession arrangement that all soldiers should return to their regions to stop the spate of killings, in which Igbo soldiers had been major victims. The Nigerian soldiers who were supposed to defend the MidWestern state were mostly Igbo from that state and, while some were in touch with their Biafran counterparts, others resisted the invasion. General Gowon responded by asking Colonel Murtala Mohammed (who later became head of state in 1975) to form another division (the 2nd Infantry Division) to expel the Biafrans from the MidWestern state, to defend the border of the Western state and to attack Biafra. At the same time, Gowon declared "total war" and announced the Federal government would mobilise the entire population of Nigeria for the war effort. From the summer of 1967 to the spring of 1969, the Federal Army grew from a force of 7,000 to a force of 200,000 men organised in three divisions. Biafra began the war with only 240 soldiers at Enugu, which grew to two battalions by August 1967, which soon were expanded into two brigades, the 51st and 52nd which became the core of the Biafran Army.

Ojukwu relocated his government without difficulty to Umuahia, a city positioned deep within traditional Igbo territory. The fall of Enugu contributed to a brief destabilisation of Biafran propaganda efforts, as the forced relocation of personnel left the Ministry of Information disorganised and the federal force's success undermined previous Biafran assertions that the Nigerian state could not withstand a protracted war.

Throughout the war, Biafran officers were far more likely to be executed by their own side than by the Federal Army as Ojukwu conducted purges and had officers who were merely accused of being "saboteurs" taken out and shot. Ojukwu did not trust the majority of the former Federal Igbo officers who had rallied to Biafra and saw them as potential rivals, thus leading to murderous purges that led to most of them being executed. Furthermore, Ojukwu needed scapegoats for Biafra's defeats and death was the usual punishment for a Biafran officers who lost a battle. Out of a fear of a coup, Ojukwu created several units such as the S Brigade commanded by himself and the 4th Commando Brigade commanded by the German mercenary Rolf Steiner that existed outside of the regular chain of command. Barua wrote that Ojukwu's leadership, especially his frequent executions of his own officers had a "disastrous impact" on the morale of the Biafran officer corps. The executions of officers also made it difficult for the Biafran officers to acquire the necessary experience to conduct military operations successfully as Barua noted the Biafran Army lacked both the "continuity and cohesion" to learn from the war.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-65</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_65-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_65-text>Oil exploration in Nigeria was pioneered by the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company in 1937. In a bid to control the oil in the eastern region, the Federal government placed a shipping embargo on the territory. This embargo did not include oil tankers. The leadership of Biafra wrote to Shell-BP demanding royalties for the oil that was being explored in their region. After much deliberation, Shell-BP decided to pay Biafra the sum of 250,000 pounds. The news of this payment reached the Federal government, which immediately extended the shipping embargo to oil tankers. The Nigerian government also made it clear to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay all outstanding oil royalties immediately. With the stalling on the payment for Biafra, the government instructed Shell-BP to stop operations in Biafra and took over from the company.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-66</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_66-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_66-text>Towards the end of July 1967, Nigerian federal troops and marines captured Bonny Island in the Niger Delta, thereby taking control of vital Shell-BP facilities.

The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at Forçados brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1.08 million barrels/day.

Therefore, it placed a high priority on maintenance of oil extraction and refining operations. The war broke out just a week before the Six-Day War in the Middle East led to the Suez Canal being blocked, forcing oil tankers from the Middle East to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, thereby increasing the cost of Middle Eastern oil. In turn, this increased the importance of Nigerian oil to Britain, because Nigerian oil was cheaper than Persian Gulf oil. Initially, when it was unclear which side would prevail, Britain took a "wait and see" approach before deciding decisively for Nigeria.&nbsp;Nigeria had a navy of only 6 vessels, the largest of which was a frigate; an air force of 76 planes, none of which were fighters or bombers; and an army of 7,000 men with no tanks and a shortage of officers with command experience. Though Biafra was likewise similarly weak, the two sides appeared evenly matched at the beginning of the war, and Nigerian victory was by no means considered preordained.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-70</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_70-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_70-text>Britain backed the Federal Government but, when the war broke out, cautioned them not to damage British oil installations in the East.

Two-thirds of this oil came from the Eastern region, and another third from the newly created Mid-West region. Two-fifths of all Nigerian oil ended up in Britain.

The British government advised that paying Biafra could undermine the goodwill of the Federal Government. Shell-BP made the payment, and the government established a blockade on oil exports. Forced to choose a side, Shell-BP and the British government threw in their lot with the Federal Government in Lagos, apparently calculating that this side would be more likely to win the war.

The British-trained Nigerian military tended to be distrustful of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet ambassador in Lagos, Alexander Romanov, a gregarious and friendly man as well as a shrewd diplomat, established an excellent rapport with Gowon and persuaded him that accepting Soviet weapons would not mean subjection to the Soviet Union. The first MiG-17s arrived in Nigeria in August 1967 together with some about 200 Soviet technicians to train the Nigerians in their use. Though the MiG-17s turned out to be too sophisticated for the Nigerians to use properly, requiring Egyptian Air Force pilots to fly them, the Soviet-Nigerian arms deal turned out to be one of the turning points of the war. Besides establishing an arms pipeline from the Soviet Union to Nigeria, the possibility that the Soviet Union would gain greater influence in Nigeria led Britain to increase its supply of arms to maintain its influence in Lagos while ruling out the possibility of either the United States or Britain recognizing Biafra.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-91</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_91-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_91-text>The Soviet Union consistently supplied Nigeria with weapons, with the diplomatic disclaimer that these were "strictly for cash on a commercial basis".

Meanwhile, as elsewhere, the situation in Biafra became publicised as a genocide. The Knesset publicly debated this issue on 17 and 22 July 1968, winning applause from the press for its sensitivity. Right-wing and left-wing political groups, and student activists, spoke for Biafra. In August 1968, the Israeli Air Force overtly sent twelve tons of food aid to a nearby site outside of Nigerian (Biafran) airspace. Covertly, Mossad provided Biafra with $100,000 (through Zurich) and attempted an arms shipment. Soon after, Israel arranged to make clandestine weapons shipments to Biafra using Côte d'Ivoire transport planes. The nations of sub-Saharan Africa tended to support the Arabs in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute by voting for resolutions sponsored by Arab states at the United Nations.

Although Nigeria appeared to be a tougher opponent, commentators observing the war noted that the remaining mercenaries appeared to have developed a personal or ideological commitment to Biafra's cause, which is a rare trait for mercenaries. Belgian mercenary Marc Goosens, who was killed by defensive Nigerian forces in a suicide mission during Operation Hiroshima, was reportedly motivated by his hatred of the British government (which supported Nigeria during the war). Steiner claimed to have fought for Biafra for idealistic reasons, saying the Igbo people were the victims of genocide, but the American journalist Ted Morgan mocked his claims, describing Steiner as a militarist who simply craved war because killing was the only thing he knew how to do well. Journalist Frederick Forsyth quotes Taffy Williams speaking of his Biafran subordinates, "I've seen a lot of Africans at war. But there's nobody to touch these people. Give me 10,000 Biafrans for six months, and we'll build an army that would be invincible on this continent.

However, in 1969, the Biafrans launched several offensives against the Nigerians in their attempts to keep the Nigerians off-balance starting in March when the 14th Division of the Biafran army recaptured Owerri and moved towards Port Harcourt, but were halted just north of the city. In May 1969, Biafran commandos recaptured oil wells in Kwale. In July 1969, Biafran forces launched a major land offensive supported by foreign mercenary pilots continuing to fly in food, medical supplies and weapons. Most notable of the mercenaries was Swedish Count Carl Gustav von Rosen who led air attacks with five Malmö MFI-9 MiniCOIN small piston-engined aircraft, armed with rocket pods and machine guns. His Biafran Air Force consisted of three Swedes: von Rosen, Gunnar Haglund and Martin Lang. The other two pilots were Biafrans: Willy Murray-Bruce and Augustus Opke.

Awareness of a mounting crisis rose in 1968. Information spread especially through religious networks, beginning with alerts from missionaries. It did not escape the notice of worldwide Christian organisations that the Biafrans were Christian and the northern Nigerians controlling the federal government were Muslim. Among these Christian efforts were the organization Joint Church Aid and Caritas, the latter aligned with various international Catholic aid groups. The famine was a result of the blockade that the Nigerian government had imposed on the Eastern region in the months leading up to secession. Frederick Forsyth, then a journalist in Nigeria and later a successful novelist, observed that the main problem was kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency. Prior to the civil war, the main source of dietary protein was dried fish imported from Norway, which was supplemented by local hogs, chicken and eggs. The blockade prevented imports, and local protein supplies were quickly depleted: "The national diet was now almost 100% starch."</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-117</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_117-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_117-text>Many volunteer bodies organised the Biafran airlift which provided blockade-breaking relief flights into Biafra, carrying food, medicines, and sometimes (according to some claims) weapons.

Both sides relied heavily on external support. Biafra hired the New York public relations firm of Ruder and Finn to lobby American public opinion. However, it was not until Biafra hired the Geneva public relations Markpress in January 1968 that significant international sympathy was won. Markpress was headed by an American public relations executive, William Bernhardt, who was paid 12,000 Swiss francs per month for his services, and who expected a share of Biafra's oil revenues after the war. Markpress's portrayal of the war as a struggle for freedom by the Catholic Igbos against the Muslim-dominated north won the support of Catholic opinion all over the world, especially in the United States. Besides portraying the war as a Christian-Muslim conflict, Markpress accused the Federal government of waging genocide against the Igbos, a campaign that was extremely effective as pictures of starving Igbos won the sympathy of the world.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-125</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_125-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_125-text>Media campaigns focused on the plight of the Biafrans intensified internationally in the summer of 1968.

In Britain, humanitarian aid used familiar discourses of imperial responsibility; in Ireland, advertisements appealed to shared Catholicism and experiences of civil war. Both of these appeals channeled older cultural values into support for the new model of international NGOs. In Ireland, public opinion identified intensely with Biafra as most of the Catholic priests working in Biafra were Irish who naturally sympathized with the Biafrans, who they saw as fellow Catholics struggling for independence. The Irish journalist John Hogan who covered the war noted: "The threat of famine, combined with an independence struggle, had an almost irresistible political and emotional impact on Irish public opinion, which became hugely supportive of the regular airlifts, via the off-shore Portuguese island of São Tomé, of food and medical supplies to the beleaguered infant republic". The use of famine as a conscious tactic by the Federal government who wanted to starve Biafra into submission provoked parallels with the Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s while many Irish people saw a parallel with Igbo struggle for independence with their own independence struggle. The pro-Biafra British journalist Frederick Forsyth started covering the war in the summer of 1967 for the BBC, became angry at the pro-Nigeria stance of the British government and resigned in protest in September 1967. Returning as a freelance journalist in 1968, Forysth worked closely with the Irish Holy Ghost Fathers to collect information about the famine, and whose dispatches from Biafra had an immense impact on British public opinion.&nbsp;</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-127</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_127-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_127-text>In Israel, the Holocaust comparison was promoted, as was the theme of threat from hostile Muslim neighbors.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>NigerianCivilWar-128</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_128-body><p class=card-text id=NigerianCivilWar_paragraph_128-text>The Biafran war presented Westerners with the notion of starving African children.

The final Nigerian offensive, named "Operation Tail-Wind", was launched on 7 January 1970 with the 3rd Marine Commando Division attacking, and supported by the 1st Infantry division to the north and the 2nd Infantry division to the south. The Biafran towns of Owerri fell on 9 January, and Uli on 11 January.

It has been estimated that up to one million people may have died due to the conflict, most from hunger and disease caused by Nigerian forces. More than half a million people died from the famine imposed deliberately through blockade throughout the war. Lack of medicine also contributed. Thousands of people starved to death every day as the war progressed. (The International Committee of the Red Cross in September 1968 estimated 8,000–10,000 deaths from starvation each day.) The leader of a Nigerian peace conference delegation said in 1968 that "starvation is a legitimate weapon of war and we have every intention of using it against the rebels". This stance is generally considered to reflect the policy of the Nigerian government.

However, actions by Biafra authorities suggesting they favored the Igbo majority turned these attitudes negative. Great suspicion was directed towards ethnic minorities and opponents of Biafra, with 'combing' exercises conducted to sift these communities for saboteurs, or 'sabo,' as they were commonly branded. This brand was widely feared, as it generally resulted in death by the Biafran forces or even mobs. The accusations subjected entire communities to violence in the form of killings, rapes, kidnapping and internments in camps by Biafran forces.

Critics of this position acknowledge that starvation policies were pursued deliberately and that accountability has not been sought for the 1966 pogroms, but suggest that claims of genocide are incongruous with the fact that the Igbo were not exterminated after the war ended, alongside other arguments such as a lack of clarity surrounding Nigerian intentions and that Nigeria was fighting to retain control of Biafra and its people rather than to expel or exterminate them. Biafra made a formal complaint of genocide against Igbos to the International Committee on the Investigation of Crimes of Genocide, which concluded that the actions undertaken by the Nigerian government against the Igbo amounted to a genocide. With special reference to the Asaba Massacre, jurist Emma Okocha described the killings as "the first black-on-black genocide".

This reasoning was also extended to Igbo-owned properties and houses. People from other regions were quick to take over any house owned by an Igbo, especially in the Port Harcourt area. The Nigerian Government justified this by terming such properties abandoned. This, however, has led to a feeling of an injustice as the Nigerian government policies were seen as further economically disabling the Igbos even long after the war. Further feelings of injustice were caused by Nigeria changing its currency, so that Biafran supplies of pre-war Nigerian currency were no longer honoured. At the end of the war, only N£20 was given to any easterner regardless of the amount of money he or she had had in the bank. This was applied irrespective of their banking in pre-war Nigerian currency or Biafran currency.

Nigeria is composed of various ethnic groups and cultures and the term Nigerian refers to a citizenship-based civic nationality. Nigerians derive from over 250 ethnic groups and languages. Though there are multiple ethnic groups in Nigeria, economic factors result in significant mobility of Nigerians of multiple ethnic and religious backgrounds to reside in territories in Nigeria that are outside their ethnic or religious background, resulting in the mixing of the various ethnic and religious groups, especially in Nigeria's cities. The English language is the "lingua franca" of Nigerians. 53.5% of Nigerians are Muslims and about 45.5% are Christians, this was as a result of the population which the northern region has a larger landmass than both the Western and Eastern regions combined.

Northern Nigeria has been culturally influenced by Islamic influence including several major historic Islamic states in the region. The Kanem-Bornu Empire and the Sokoto Caliphate were major historical Islamic states in northern Nigeria. Southern Nigeria historically held several powerful states, including the Benin Empire and Oyo Empire, Ife Confederacy and several other Yoruba states.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>Nigerians-5</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=Nigerians_paragraph_5-body><p class=card-text id=Nigerians_paragraph_5-text>Nigerian culture was profoundly affected by the British colonial rule. Such as British colonial authorities denouncements and attacks upon polygamy, trial by ordeal, and certain types of sacrifices. At the same time, British colonial authorities maintained and promoted traditional Nigerian culture that strengthened colonial administration. The British spread Christianity throughout southern Nigeria and Christian missionaries assisted British authorities in establishing a Western-style education system in Nigeria that resulted in the teaching of the English language in Nigeria and its subsequent adoption as Nigeria's main language. The British replaced unpaid household labor with wage labor. Prior to colonization in the twentieth century, Nigeria's tribes usually possessed the land as a community, such that land could not be bought or sold. Colonization brought the notion of individuals owning land and commercialization of land began.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>Nigerians-6</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=Nigerians_paragraph_6-body><p class=card-text id=Nigerians_paragraph_6-text>In Nigeria, more than seventy percent of Nigerians live in villages of two different types: the first type used by the Igbo and Tiv involves a collection of dispersed compounds while the second type used amongst the Hausa fulani, Yoruba, and Kanuri involves nucleii of compounds. These villages compose members of the ethnicity-related through ancestry as well as strangers who have been assimilated into the ethnicity. Since the time prior to colonization to the present it has been a common practice of Nigeria's tribes to adopt strangers into the tribes. A male elder in the community commonly serves as a village chief or Baale.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>Nigerians-7</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=Nigerians_paragraph_7-body><p class=card-text id=Nigerians_paragraph_7-text>In the large cities of Nigeria, there is a substantial intermingling of Nigerians with foreigners, especially Europeans, Lebanese, and Indians. The economic importance of Nigeria's cities has resulted in migrations of people from their traditional ethnic or cultural homeland to cities outside those territories. Igbo, Hausa-Fulani and Ibibio people have commonly migrated to Lagos and many southerners migrate to the north to trade or work while a number of northern seasonal workers and small-scale entrepreneurs go to the south.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>Nigerians-9</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=Nigerians_paragraph_9-body><p class=card-text id=Nigerians_paragraph_9-text>Ethnic, religious, and regional disputes and tensions have commonly divided Nigerians on political issues. In particular, cultural and political divisions between the Muslim north and the Christian south has politicized religion and caused significant political disputes in Nigeria. Ethnic-motivated and religious-motivated violence by extremists has increased these tensions as well.</p></div><br><h5 class=section_header style=font-family:serif>Nigerians-10</h5><div class=card-body-paragraphs-sectioned id=Nigerians_paragraph_10-body><p class=card-text id=Nigerians_paragraph_10-text>However, despite instances of extremism, most Nigerians continue to peacefully coexist, and a common Nigerian identity has been fostered amongst the more-educated and affluent Nigerians as well as with the many Nigerians who leave small homogeneous ethnic communities to seek economic opportunities in the cities where the population is ethnically mixed. Although there are cultural divisions amongst Nigerians, the English language is commonly used as their primary language. Also, most Nigerians share a strong commitment to individual liberties and democracy. Even during periods of military rule, such military governments were pressured to maintain democratic stances by the Nigerian people. Nigeria's political figures commonly know multiple indigenous languages outside their own indigenous language.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-body><h4 class=article-title><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnamdi_Azikiwe target=_blank class=passageLink>Nnamdi Azikiwe</a></h4><span class=span-link id=5-article_collapse_link>[show article]</span><div id=5-paragraphs style=display:none></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-body><h4 class=article-title><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obafemi_Awolowo target=_blank class=passageLink>Obafemi Awolowo</a></h4><span class=span-link id=6-article_collapse_link>[show article]</span><div id=6-paragraphs style=display:none></div></div></div></div>
