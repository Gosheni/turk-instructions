<h3>Answering a Reading Comprehension Task</h3>
You are answering a reading comprehension test. You will read a <b>paragraph</b> and some <b>question</b>s, and a few <b>options</b> for its answer. You will have to choose the <b>correct</b> answer(s) from the options.<br>
Note that sometimes, <span style="color: red">more than one option </span> can answer the question correctly and completely. In those cases, <span style="color: red">please select all such options</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an example:
<div class="boxedBig">
<h4>Paragraph:</h4>
Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at KapiÊ»olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.<br>
He is the only President to have been born in Hawaii. He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942-1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent, with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> How old was Obama's mother when he was born?

<div class="form-group">
<div class="col-lg-10"><label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> teenager </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> in his 40s </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> mid 20s </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input checked="checked" onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> almost twenty </label></div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Explanation: </b> Obama was born in 1961. His mother was born in 1942 and 1961-1942=19. The good option (almost twenty) answers the question correctly. The bad answers give an incorrect answer.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> Where was Ann living in August, 1961?

<div class="form-group">
<div class="col-lg-10"><label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> KapiÊ»olani Maternity </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input checked="checked" onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> Honolulu, Hawaii </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> Wichita </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> England </label><br>
<label class="checkbox-inline"><input checked="checked" onclick="return false;" type="checkbox"> Honolulu </label></div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Explanation: </b> Ann is Obama's mother (Sent 4). She must have been there when Obama was born (Sent 1). Obama was born in Hawaii (Sent 2). Hawaii is also in Honolulu. So both Hawaii and Honolulu answer the question correctly. Kansas and Scottland don't answer the question correctly.</div>
