<h1>Find Important Sentences That Should be Included in a Meeting Report</h1>
<p>Note: <span style="color:red"> <b>DO NOT DO THIS TASK</b> if you have worked on 	this <u><i>particular</i></u> meeting before.</span> (Check the sentences in the table under &quot;The 	sentences to label&quot; to make sure.) If you do this task again, you may not get paid!</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
<p>You will be shown sentences that people spoke in a meeting. Someone else (not you!) needs to write a report on the meeting. Your job is to find <b>important</b> sentences that should be included in the report, <b>unimportant</b> sentences that should not be included in the report, and <b>neutral</b> sentences that the report-writer may or may not include in the report.</p>
<p>In the table below, do the following for each row:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Read the sentence in the row.</li>
    <li>If you think that the sentence <b><i>should </i></b>be included in the report - click on the circle next to the word <b>important</b> in the row.</li>
    <li>If you think that the sentence <b><i>should not</i></b> be included in the report - click on the circle next to the word<i> </i><b>unimportant</b>.</li>
    <li>If you think that the sentence is of medium importance and may or may not need to be in the report - click on the circle next to the word <b>neutral</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples </b> (these are just examples, there may be other sentences that don't fit these types):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Examples of <b>important</b> sentences:
    <ul>
        <li>A sentence in which someone is reporting on work done / progress since last week, or the outcome of something he's done.</li>
        <li>A sentence in which someone is talking of a problem.</li>
        <li>A sentence in which someone is discussing a future plan of action.</li>
        <li>A sentence that summarizes a long discussion.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Example of <b>neutral</b> sentences:
    <ul>
        <li>Sentences describing something in minute details. If there is a sentence that has a <i>summary </i>of the details, that sentence is likely to be <b>important</b>, and the sentences with the minute details are likely to be <b>neutral</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Examples of <b>unimportant</b> sentences:
    <ul>
        <li>A sentence where someone is telling a joke that has little to do with the rest of the meeting.</li>
        <li>Sentences that are about the <i>dynamics</i> of the meeting, e.g. &quot;Let's go on to the next agenda item.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tips to improve your work:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>If some parts of a long sentence seem important and other parts don't, label the sentence as <b>important</b>.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, if a sentence seems to have been broken into two or three lines, you can label each of those lines differently if you want.</li>
    <li>Generally in these meetings, about a quarter of the sentences are <b>important</b>, a quarter are <b>neutral</b> and half are <b>unimportant</b>.</li>
</ul>
