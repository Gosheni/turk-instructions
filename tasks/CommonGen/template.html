            <h3>Collect common scences with given concepts</h3>
            <p>Dear users, we would like to collect <strong>setnences describing everyday scenes</strong> in everyday life about given concepts (nouns/verbs), as well as the <strong>background commonsense knowledge</strong> about them.</p>
            <p>For example, given a set of concepts: <strong>{apple,  bag, put, tree, pick}</strong>. (the order does <strong>NOT</strong> matter)</p>
            <p>You can describe a natural scene with a simple sentence containing all of them like: </p>
            <p><em>"A boy <strong>picks</strong> some <strong>apples</strong> from a <strong>tree</strong> and <strong>puts</strong> them into a <strong>bag</strong>."</em></p>
            <p>You also need to write some sentences about the <strong>common sense knowledge</strong> that you used in writing the sentence:</p>
            <p>"Apples are grown on trees. Bag is a container. You can pick something and then put them in a container."</p>
           
           
        </short-summary>
        <detailed-instructions>
            <!--<h3>Collect common scences with given concepts</h3>-->
            <p>The set of given concepts are randomly ordered and you should ignore the order when writing the sentences.</p>
            <p>The sentence is better to be <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>grammatical</strong>, and describes a <strong>natural</strong> scene in our daily life.
            <ul>
            <li>You can use other forms of the given words to make the sentence grammatical, like plural forms (e.g. apples) and subject-verb agreement rules (e.g. picks, puts).</li>
            <li>You can add some new concepts like "boy" to make the scenes natural and complete. </li>
            <li>It is better to be with <strong>simple present tense</strong> and <strong>active voice</strong>.</li>
            <li>Use specific words "a/an man/woman/girl/boy/adult/teenager/group of guys/..." instead of pronouns "I/You/He/She/They".
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The commonsense knowledge is a set of simple sentences descibing facts behind the scene, which make it common. They must be also grammatical following the above requirements.</p>
        </detailed-instructions>
