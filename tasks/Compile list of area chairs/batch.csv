organizers, the tutorial presenters, the authors of main conference and demo papers, the reviewers for
their contribution, and all the attendees for participation.  I hope everyone have a great time and enjoy
this conference.
There are many individuals to thank for their contributions to ACL-IJCNLP 2015.  We would like to
thank the 37 area chairs for their hard work on recruiting reviewers, leading the discussion process, and
carefully ranking the submissions.  We would also like to thank the 749 primary and the 137 secondary
reviewers on whose efforts we depended to select high-quality and timely scientific work. This year we
specifically acknowledge around 18.2% of the reviewers who went the extra mile and provided extremely
helpful reviews (their names are marked with a * in the organization section of the proceedings).  The
ACL coordinating committee members, including Dragomir Radev, Graeme Hirst, Jian Su, and Gertjan
van Noord were invaluable on various issues relating to the organization.  We would like to thank the
prior conference chairs Kristina Toutanova and Hua Wu and their predecessors for their advice.  We are
very grateful for the guidance and support of the general chair Yuji Matsumoto, to the ACL Business
Manager Priscilla Rasmussen who knew practically everything, to the local chairs Le Sun and Yang Liu,
the publication chairs Wanxiang Che and Guodong Zhou, and webmaster Zhiyuan Liu.  We would also
like to thank Jiajun Zhang who helped with reviewer assignment and numerous other tasks. Rich Gerber
and Paolo Gai from Softconf were extremely responsive to all of our requests, and we are grateful for
that."

We asked the area chairs to work in pairs, so they
can have a back-up in case other obligations need their attention during the review period and to ensure
that all decisions about reviewer assignment and paper recommendation are discussed in detail.  All
area chairs and reviewers submitted a list of keywords that describe their area of expertise (the full list
appears in the conference call for papers). The area chairs were paired based on the keyword overlap.
To match reviewers to area chairs, we used a bidding system.  For bidding, each area received a list of
the 140 reviewers with best matching keyword profiles.  If the area chairs did not know the work of a
potential reviewer on their bidding list, they looked him or her up on DBLP or Google Scholar before
making their final bid.  Areas were assigned only reviewers for which the area chairs bid positively.
Area chairs were free as usual to recruit additional reviewers they wished to work with.
Submissions were assigned to areas by taking into account the match between the paper keywords and
the area chair keywords.  Areas were capped at 40 submissions maximum (long and short combined).
As in the past, reviewers bid on papers they wanted to review.  69% of the reviews were written by
reviewers who had bid indicating that they want to review the paper; 29% of the reviews were written
by reviewers who had bid indicating they are ok with reviewing the paper. The remaining 2% of reviews
v
were written by reviewers who did not bid on the paper but were asked by an area chair to review it.
Three reviewers were assigned a paper that they did not want to review according to their bid.  The
average reviewer load was 3 papers, which included a mix of long and short submissions.  Only 43
reviewers had more than four papers to review.
Area  chairs  wrote  meta-reviews,  for  use  only  by  us,  justifying  their  accept/reject  recommendation.
In making difficult decisions, we drew on these meta-reviews, the reviews themselves, the discussion
among the reviewers, and the author response to the initial reviews.
We are happy with our changes to the review process:  area chairs had control over the reviewers they
worked with, reviewers were assigned papers they wanted to review and the overall reviewing load was
low.  Needless to say, there is room for further improvements.  The reviewing process is crucial to the
quality of this conference; only if the community has confidence in the quality of the reviewing process
will this conference continue to be a leading conference in our field.  Our goal has been to make sure
that every single submission receives a complete and fair review and decision, and to make sure that
the authors of every single submission understand why their paper was accepted or declined for the
conference.  We would like to thank our 685 reviewers, and we would especially like to thank our 42
area chairs, who were patient in allowing us to pursue some of the innovative aspects of this year’s
reviewing cycle"
