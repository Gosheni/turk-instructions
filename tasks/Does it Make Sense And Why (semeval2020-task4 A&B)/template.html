        <short-summary>
			<p>Write a total of  five sentences. </p>
			<p>The first should be a correct statement; </p>
			<p>The second one which does not make sense, using a <b>similar sentence structure</b> as the first.  </p>
			<p>Thirdly the right reason why the incorrect statement does not make common sense, </p>
			<p>Finally provide two confusing reasons to confuse the machine.</p>
        </short-summary>
        <detailed-instructions>
            <h3>There are several rules you should follow when you write samples:</h3>

                <p>1. <b>Each confusing reason should contain all common important information in the incorrect statement and the right reason.</b> 
                    For example, in the good example1, "elephant" and "fridge" are the important information 
                    since both of them appear in the incorrect statement and the right reason. 
                    So, the two confusing reasons should contain 'elephant' and 'fridge'</p>

                <p>2. <b>The confusing reasons should be correct themselves. </b>See at the bad example 2.</p>

                <p>3. <b>If some information only appear at 'correct statement' but not 'incorrect statement' or 'right reason',
                please don't mention the information at the two confusing reasons.</b> 
                For example, in the good example1, the confusing reasons should not mention "turkey", 
                since the incorrect statement and the right reason don't mention 'turkey'.</p>

                <p>4. The right and confusing reasons should be in similar length.</p>

                <p>5. Make the questions easy to understand.</p>

                <p>6. Avoid using specific knowledge, like persons, places, history.</p>

                <p>7. The right reason should not be just like the correct statement.</p>

                <p>8. Please don't simply add a 'not' to the incorrect statement to form the reason.</p>
                
                <p>9. Please don't imitate the "elephant" and "fridge" example. We will reject all "XX cannot fit in YY" or "XX is bigger/smaller than YY" answers.</p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes (Examples can be viewed below)</h3>
            <p>You should not use knowledge, like specific persons, places, history, to write statements.</p>
            <p>The confusing reasons should not lack some important information from the incorrect statement and the right reason.</p>
            <p>You should not try to find specific case where the statement is true</p>
            <p>Don't make the right reasons be always too short or too long among the three reasons.</p>
            <p>The reasons should not mention correct statements.</p>
            <p>The confusing reasons should not be wrong themselves.</p>
        </negative-example>

        <negative-example>
            <h3>Bad Example1:</h3>
            <h5>Correct Statement</h5>
            <p>Donald Trump succeed Barack Obama as the president of US</p>
            <h5>Incorrect Statement</h5>
            <p>Barack Obama succeed Donald Trump as the president of US</p>
            <p>(these statements are knowledge rather than common sense. Don't use specific persons, places, history, etc, to write statements)</p>
            <h5>Right Reason</h5>
            <p>Donald Trump became president at 2016 when Barack Obama left his office</p>
            <h5>Confusing Reason1</h5>
            <p>Donald Trump was a bussiness man</p>
            <p>(The confusing reasons should contain all important information in the incorrect statemens. In this case, it misses 'Barack Obama' and 'president'.)</p>
            <h5>Confusing Reason2</h5>
            <p>Barack Obama may get elected as president again after Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>(Don't try to find specific case where the statement is true.)</p>

            <h3>Bad Example2:</h3>
            <h5>Correct Statement</h5>
            <p>my sister eats an apple after breakfast every day</p>
            <h5>Incorrect Statement</h5>
            <p>my sister eats a stone after breakfast every day</p>
            <h5>Right Reason</h5>
            <p>stones are too hard</p>
            <p>(too short among three reasons)</p>
            <h5>Confusing Reason1</h5>
            <p>apples are more suitable than stone for breakfast</p>
            <p>(don't mention the correct statement in the reasons)</p>
            <h5>Confusing Reason2</h5>
            <p>stones are too expensive so no one eats them</p>
            <p>("stones are too expensive" is wrong, better make all confusing reasons themselves true but only irrelavant to the statements.)</p>
