            <h3>Write down why the nonsensical statement is against common sense</h3>
            <p>Given two statements, one is sensical, the other is non-sensical, write down why the non-sensical statement is against common sense. </p>
            <h4>Please write the reason, don't simply add a 'not' or 'can't' to the statement to make an explanation.</h4>
            <h4>Please write the reason, don't use "XXX is not for YYY" as an explanation.</h4>
            <h4>Please don’t explain why the correct statement makes sense.</h4>
            <h4>Try to avoid mentioning the sensical statements if not necessary.</h4>
            <p>Do not try to justify why the incorrect statement makes sense.</p>
            <p>Don’t be overly formally and please only write one sentence.</p>
            <p>Refrain from using because at the beginning of your sentence.</p>
            <p>Don’t attempt to correct the wrong statement, just provide the reason.</p>
