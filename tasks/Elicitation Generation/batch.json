You don't have to use the\r\n  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done\r\n  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action\r\n  and to have the sentence <b>reflect the appropriate amount of time needed to\r\n  complete the action<\/b>.\r\n\r\n  <li> There are many different reasons why the actions expressed in sentences\r\n  don't take a short period of time.

You don't have to use the\r\n  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done\r\n  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action\r\n  and to have the sentence reflect that movement is (or is not) happening.<\/b>\r\n\r\n  <li> There are a number of different reasons why sentences might not have\r\n  movement.  The thing doing the action might not have a physical presence or\r\n  the \"action\" is actually a thought or a state which doesn't require any\r\n  movement.  Here are some sentences where movement is <b>not<\/b> taking place.\r\n\r\n       <ul>\r\n        <li> <i>push<\/i>: I pushed myself to finish the project.\r\n        <li> <i>jumped<\/i>: The corporation <i>jumped<\/i> to a silly conclusion.\r\n        <li> <i>like<\/i>: John <i>likes<\/i> beer.\r\n       <\/ul>\r\n\r\n  <li> Sentences where movement happens clearly have someone or something\r\n  performing a physical action.

If so, click the box that says \"it's not possible to\r\n  write such a sentence.\"\r\n\r\n  <li> Note that we're interested in what happens with the action happens, not\r\n  what happens before or after.
