This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""  
  
[My opponent has done nothing to refute the claim that the content of an institute of higher education has nothing to do with that institutes's name. My original contention stands.]

Politics is a messy business. People with money finance campaigns, and in return, they expect those politicians whose campaigns they financed to help them out a bit.  
No more should this occur. These are not democratic ideals. This country was founded on the notion that every taxpayer should have the same amount of say in government. That, unfortunately, does not hold true. To fix the situation, we must reform campaign finance. No more will we be a society where the wealthy and powerful make the rules while the everyman has barely any say. We should not stand for this.  
  
There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed. I am not advocating any specific way, I am simply noting that there is a problem and some type of reform is necessary to fix it.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",14917,The ontological argument,4) God is not natural.,"
  
This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",value,Value,,

""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:

*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]

""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]

[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole.

1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.

These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election.

This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.

I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.

------------  
Refutations  
------------  
  
""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""  
  
[My opponent has done nothing to refute the claim that the content of an institute of higher education has nothing to do with that institutes's name. My original contention stands.]

Refutations

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""  
  
[My opponent has done nothing to refute the claim that the content of an institute of higher education has nothing to do with that institutes's name. My original contention stands.]

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.

[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim.

Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]

""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""

[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]

Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""  
  
[My opponent has done nothing to refute the claim that the content of an institute of higher education has nothing to do with that institutes's name. My original contention stands.]

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",value,Fact,,

  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist.

*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]

[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.

  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",36089,Should abortion be made illegal?,That is what it is.,"
  
Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

5. Not counting these foundation rules, each player can only create 3 rules per turn.  
  
6. Each player must produce 3 rules per round or they forfeit.  
  
7. Rules cannnot result in an auto-win. Breaking a rule cannot result in the victory of the rule-breaker. Each player should have an oppportunity to not break each rule.

  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition.

I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.

  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",value,Fact,,

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""  
  
[My opponent has done nothing to refute the claim that the content of an institute of higher education has nothing to do with that institutes's name. My original contention stands.]

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election. While many people worry about lobbyists and companies buying up politicians one need look no further than Barack Obama. He ran an entire campaign primarily off small contributions from everyday people. He raised more money than any campaign in history without taking a dime from lobbyists. We need to keep our politicians accountable rather than have them write more loopholes into clever sounding laws.  
  
This campaign season we discovered a rather impressive loophole that McCain wrote into the McCain-Feingold Campaign finance reform bill that exempts travel on your wife's private company jet. Who's wife would even have a private company jet? Oh, McCain's wife does. -- We don't need to change the law we need to enforce the laws we have and make politicians accountable to the people. That's the point of democracy.  
  
Ross Perot did do well because he had money. If you want to spend your money to run a political campaign you can still do this. Mitt Romney this election cycle was largely self-funded. But, ultimately it's the people who decide regardless of where the money comes from. Perot failed. Romney failed. And lobbyists, such as those running McCain's campaign, failed.  
  
The system works. What we really need are run off elections and the ability of third party candidates to have a voice without sapping votes off from the second choice candidates. We need a fair and productive system for all the voices in politics. As it turns out, the laws we have work and people don't forgive those in the pockets of corporations.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]

""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]

""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election.

Who's wife would even have a private company jet? Oh, McCain's wife does. -- We don't need to change the law we need to enforce the laws we have and make politicians accountable to the people. That's the point of democracy.  
  
Ross Perot did do well because he had money. If you want to spend your money to run a political campaign you can still do this. Mitt Romney this election cycle was largely self-funded. But, ultimately it's the people who decide regardless of where the money comes from. Perot failed. Romney failed. And lobbyists, such as those running McCain's campaign, failed.

She won't be able to afford proper prenatal care...and not every person in that situation will have someone financially backing them that wants that baby.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth. Therefore the argument laid out above does not in fact prove the existence of God as Pro claims, it simply assumes it.

We live in a very 'status' society where a university degree is considered 'top of the line' and a college diploma is considered 'a step down.' It has been noted that a four year university graduate make $250,000 or more than their college counterparts. However, this has been disproved by April Norhanian, a former college recruiter. She wrote a book called ""College Is for Suckers –The FIRST College Guide You Should Read."" She states how despite ones credentials, it doesn't necessarily guarantee oneself a career or even a job. Furthermore, she asserts that university bound students don't necessarily even need to go to university because without a four year degree they would still make the same amount of money and be as successful because they have already developed a strong work ethic and other related traits. She states that if a student is in the bottom forty percent of his or her high school class, they will have a very difficult time in graduating university even if they are given eight and half years.  
  
To conclude, does one really need to spend $30,000 for a four year BA degree. My answer is no.

We live in a very 'status' society where a university degree is considered 'top of the line' and a college diploma is considered 'a step down.' It has been noted that a four year university graduate make $250,000 or more than their college counterparts. However, this has been disproved by April Norhanian, a former college recruiter. She wrote a book called ""College Is for Suckers –The FIRST College Guide You Should Read."" She states how despite ones credentials, it doesn't necessarily guarantee oneself a career or even a job. Furthermore, she asserts that university bound students don't necessarily even need to go to university because without a four year degree they would still make the same amount of money and be as successful because they have already developed a strong work ethic and other related traits. She states that if a student is in the bottom forty percent of his or her high school class, they will have a very difficult time in graduating university even if they are given eight and half years.

  Someone had to take this. I make the following argument with the utmost respect for Pro and his beliefs:  
  1) Santa Clause’s existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  2) Santa Clause’s existence is not logically impossible.  3) Therefore, Santa Clause necessarily exists.  
  Premise 1 is true because I will define Santa Clause in a way that does not allow for any contingencies.  
  Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define Santa Clause using only negative properties; such properties that I will simply make up are necessarily logically compatible.  
  Conclusion  
  Pro claims that this argument can not be used to show that something which isn't godlike exists. Pro is confusing his argument with his definition. His definition is of a godlike being, so of course it would not fit anything other then a godlike being. However the logic of the argument is not dependant on the definition he chose.   
  There is no dispute over premise 2 that God is logically possible. However Premise 1 basically states that because he is possible he is necessary. Such an argument can be used to assume the existence of anything, that does not prove that that which is being argued for does in fact exist. One can easily say that God is logically possible but may not exist. Pro offered nothing to dispute this obvious truth.

It's bad to abort, when the child will end up dying from starvation or disease? It's bad to not end the life before they suffer? And every single child can not be adopted or sponsored...not every person can be forbidden to have sex. Will they abort anyways? Probably not, but it's an example.  
  
Think of a woman that gets pregnant. She can't even pay for her own food bills. How is she going to pay for a child? She won't be able to afford proper prenatal care...and not every person in that situation will have someone financially backing them that wants that baby. She won't be able to work during a certain time during her late pregnancy, so who will pay her bills then? So wouldn't it be better to abort the child?",value,Testimony,,

We live in a very 'status' society where a university degree is considered 'top of the line' and a college diploma is considered 'a step down.' It has been noted that a four year university graduate make $250,000 or more than their college counterparts. However, this has been disproved by April Norhanian, a former college recruiter. She wrote a book called ""College Is for Suckers –The FIRST College Guide You Should Read."" She states how despite ones credentials, it doesn't necessarily guarantee oneself a career or even a job.

God has given us the gift of choice. Abortion is a choice.  
  
If a woman is raped and impregnated... why should she have to keep the baby? Every day she sees that child, she will be reminded of that incident.  
  
If a woman has medical issues, and if she gives birth she will die...you're saying she should have to die?  
  
Think of third world countries. People with seven kids and all of them are skeletons because the parents can't afford to feed them? It's bad to abort, when the child will end up dying from starvation or disease? It's bad to not end the life before they suffer?

Well obviously my opponent is not aware that the constitution does state ""Murder is always, under no circumstances, a crime."" Once again when you abort a child, a child who has a heart, two arms and 2 legs, hair, organs, some kidneys, long story short it's still a human who hasn't and won't get the chance to live. If my opponent would like to argue about what the U.S. constitution says, doesn't it say that every human has the right to 'Live, love, and the pursuit of happiness'? Well if you decide to kill that human before it has the opportunity to enjoy and pursue those three things, wouldn't that be yet another constitution violation? Wow, you never looked at it that way did you? Obviously punishing the mother in this situation would be insane. But if we make abortion illegal mothers won't have the chance to ask for an abortion. When you make a mistake, you have to face the consequences, if you had sex and became pregnant unintentionally then that is her mistake and she must deal with the consequences, you can't just kill the child because the mother doesn't want him/her. So in conclusion if you look at my points and facts you will see that you should definitely vote pro in today's ballot. Thank you",policy,Policy,,

The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.

The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake.

In addition to this when a person casts their virtual ballot for either me or my opponent (already upset with me) they will look at the current number of votes I received and try ot counteract it, for if I'm leading they will realize I made a faulty prediction and vote against me. As the polls begin to get into closer margins of course, others will counteract this and vote for me for they see a chance I'm right. Overall the votes should balance, except that I will vote against myself and no doubt my opponent will to imp rive his track record, and me to prove myself correct. Therefore these 2 swing votes, cast at the end, will tip the balance in my opponent's favour causing me to lose.",value,Fact,,

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election. While many people worry about lobbyists and companies buying up politicians one need look no further than Barack Obama. He ran an entire campaign primarily off small contributions from everyday people. He raised more money than any campaign in history without taking a dime from lobbyists. We need to keep our politicians accountable rather than have them write more loopholes into clever sounding laws.  
  
This campaign season we discovered a rather impressive loophole that McCain wrote into the McCain-Feingold Campaign finance reform bill that exempts travel on your wife's private company jet. Who's wife would even have a private company jet? Oh, McCain's wife does. -- We don't need to change the law we need to enforce the laws we have and make politicians accountable to the people. That's the point of democracy.  
  
Ross Perot did do well because he had money. If you want to spend your money to run a political campaign you can still do this. Mitt Romney this election cycle was largely self-funded. But, ultimately it's the people who decide regardless of where the money comes from. Perot failed. Romney failed. And lobbyists, such as those running McCain's campaign, failed.  
  
The system works. What we really need are run off elections and the ability of third party candidates to have a voice without sapping votes off from the second choice candidates. We need a fair and productive system for all the voices in politics. As it turns out, the laws we have work and people don't forgive those in the pockets of corporations.

We have acceptable amounts of campaign finance regulations we simply need to enforce those regulations in order to properly ensure a fair and productive election. While many people worry about lobbyists and companies buying up politicians one need look no further than Barack Obama. He ran an entire campaign primarily off small contributions from everyday people. He raised more money than any campaign in history without taking a dime from lobbyists. We need to keep our politicians accountable rather than have them write more loopholes into clever sounding laws.  
  
This campaign season we discovered a rather impressive loophole that McCain wrote into the McCain-Feingold Campaign finance reform bill that exempts travel on your wife's private company jet. Who's wife would even have a private company jet? Oh, McCain's wife does. -- We don't need to change the law we need to enforce the laws we have and make politicians accountable to the people. That's the point of democracy.  
  
Ross Perot did do well because he had money. If you want to spend your money to run a political campaign you can still do this. Mitt Romney this election cycle was largely self-funded. But, ultimately it's the people who decide regardless of where the money comes from. Perot failed. Romney failed. And lobbyists, such as those running McCain's campaign, failed.  
  
The system works. What we really need are run off elections and the ability of third party candidates to have a voice without sapping votes off from the second choice candidates. We need a fair and productive system for all the voices in politics. As it turns out, the laws we have work and people don't forgive those in the pockets of corporations.  
  
The people aren't stupid and they vote for those who will best serve them. The politicians aren't stupid and can wiggle out of whatever laws we have them write for themselves. We must, as a people, hold them accountable.",value,Policy,,

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.  
  
Rounds:  
1st Round: Acceptance and a brief overview of your opinion.  
2nd Round: An in-depth analysis of your opinion (and reasoning behind your opinion)  
3rd round: Rebuttals and conclusion  
  
My opinion:  
I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.

2nd Round: An in-depth analysis of your opinion (and reasoning behind your opinion)  
3rd round: Rebuttals and conclusion  
  
My opinion:  
I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.

You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room.","
  
Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have.

It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits.

Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

My opinion:  
I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.

To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially.

You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe.

I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board.

She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits.

The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.  
  
Rounds:  
1st Round: Acceptance and a brief overview of your opinion.  
2nd Round: An in-depth analysis of your opinion (and reasoning behind your opinion)  
3rd round: Rebuttals and conclusion  
  
My opinion:  
I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.

So I perused through my digital copy of the Constitution, and I still found no references to murder, so if you'd like to give me a section, or line or amendment that'd be rather helpful. Also I'd like to point out that the quote you made states that murder is never a crime. ""Always, under no circumstances"" as you put it.  
  
The constitution also never declares rights to live, love and pursuit of happiness.  
In fact NO US document expresses rights to live and love.  
The Declaration of Independance however does say all men have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  
I think you need go back and reread the documents you're trying to quote. Especially before turning snarky on me.  
  
Anyways, so that takes out the constitutional violation reason for your new argument.  
  
You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that. But it doesn't have a right to override the rights of the mother.  
So take it out, and see how long it lasts. If it dies, then it wasn't meant to be. You can't really have a right to something that you're not physically capable of.  
  
When you make a mistake you do have to face the consequences, yes, but there is no rule against allieviating suffering from that mistake. Prisoners get granted early leave for good behavior, people who cause accidents still get to go to the hospital and people who get pregnant can have abortions.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

Is my opponent not aware that a mother is 77% more likely to be injured or killed during an abortion than they would having childbirth? The CDC has stated in 2015, there are 17 known side effects that can happen during an abortion, one of them being death, and one being an infection in the uterus to where the mother might not be able to have children again. Most abortions are from teenage mothers who made the mistake of having sex and became pregnant, my point being that if that infection from the uterus does affect some teens, say they want to have children when they are older, they can't because she decided she wanted to kill her mistake she made when she was younger. Obviously since this debate has started my opponent has had more evidence than me, which I congratulate you on, but who has more common sense? We obviously have to see that abortion is wrong in the eyes of my, it is also right in the eyes of many.

As a Christian, it's odd for me to know that so many people deny the existence of God. I think that if Christians understood why Atheists didn't believe in God, we could convince them to believe. Therefore, I started this debate to present why I think Christianity is viewed as a non-realistic fairytale. Here are the rules  
  
1. You must be a Christian to accept this debate.  
2. You must disagree with my opinion.  
3. You must present your opinion on why you think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists.  
4. There is no burden of proof, since this is an opinion debate. However, you must show the reasoning behind your opinions.  
  
Rounds:  
1st Round: Acceptance and a brief overview of your opinion.  
2nd Round: An in-depth analysis of your opinion (and reasoning behind your opinion)  
3rd round: Rebuttals and conclusion  
  
My opinion:  
I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith. Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits.

To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life.

It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

WOW.","
  
WOW. my first time as well. this is also going to be very hard because I do not have a lot of time to argue this proposition.  
  
Ok you defined:  
  
Chicken: a domestic fowl bred for flesh or eggs  
Egg: animal reproductive body consisting of an ovum or embryo together with nutritive and protective envelopes  
  
We can use the definition to find out what a chicken is actually considered. The first chicken actually came from two different types of species, the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. These two species of birds produced the first known chicken. Even though you used the creationism approach, it does not say in the Bible God created chickens. It says that God created birds, which does not mean he created chickens but a bird that could eventually create a new species.  
  
You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated. But it did not have the title of chicken. The word egg however was first seen in 450 around the Old English era. This also makes the point that because the word egg comes before chicken, the egg came before the chicken.",value,Value,,

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too.

WOW. my first time as well. this is also going to be very hard because I do not have a lot of time to argue this proposition.  
  
Ok you defined:  
  
Chicken: a domestic fowl bred for flesh or eggs  
Egg: animal reproductive body consisting of an ovum or embryo together with nutritive and protective envelopes  
  
We can use the definition to find out what a chicken is actually considered. The first chicken actually came from two different types of species, the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. These two species of birds produced the first known chicken. Even though you used the creationism approach, it does not say in the Bible God created chickens. It says that God created birds, which does not mean he created chickens but a bird that could eventually create a new species.  
  
You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated. But it did not have the title of chicken. The word egg however was first seen in 450 around the Old English era.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

Ok you defined:  
  
Chicken: a domestic fowl bred for flesh or eggs  
Egg: animal reproductive body consisting of an ovum or embryo together with nutritive and protective envelopes  
  
We can use the definition to find out what a chicken is actually considered. The first chicken actually came from two different types of species, the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. These two species of birds produced the first known chicken. Even though you used the creationism approach, it does not say in the Bible God created chickens. It says that God created birds, which does not mean he created chickens but a bird that could eventually create a new species.  
  
You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated. But it did not have the title of chicken. The word egg however was first seen in 450 around the Old English era.

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated.

To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness.

You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated. But it did not have the title of chicken. The word egg however was first seen in 450 around the Old English era. This also makes the point that because the word egg comes before chicken, the egg came before the chicken.",value,Fact,,

In short: it is the character and conduct of some Christians themselves. Too many Christians abuse, bully and sometimes commit atrocities. Have you heard of the Crusades? Also, many Christians preach so called holy hate like Westboro Baptist Church. Before Christians bother with other people's sins, they need to deal with their own sins. I used to bully in the name of religion, and that is my biggest regret. How many people have a turned away from Jesus? May God have mercy on me.",testimony,Value,,

Pro's first point seeks to achieve that the mental health of some teenagers is at risk through experiences in the changing room. It is an issue but this does not only happen in a gym changing room and if we were to implement your logic for even situation that teenagers feel insecure in we would be allowing those of the most important age to become hermits. School is here to teach us many skills we need in life and not all of these are taught by a teacher at a black board. The social situations you find in a typical high school are a part of growing up and I will pick this up in my substantive. She also seeks to prove that gym is a distraction and restricts studies however having competitively played basketball and done athletics for my school and outside of school through out my high school career and am now doing a masters degree in physics at university. Sport acts as a release for your brain and releases hormones that promote a feeling of well being and happiness combating stress that indeed comes with a teenagers life.  
To oppose this I want to bring in the health benefits that gym brings. As I have said it naturally brings psychological benefits which outweigh these feelings of insecurity which we all go through as teenagers in high school as part of life. It also accounts for the only exercise many high school children have. It is important to at least try and install a healthy lifestyle in children that are subjected to a culture of fast food and laziness. As the government is responsible for children's well being while in school it is their duty to install a well rounded education and this includes sport.  
Being able to co-operate in a team even amongst people you would not usually be inclined to like is a very important life skill to learn because out in the real world, in work and daily life you will still have to co-operate maturely with people who you may not like. ""High School Never Ends"". Team skills are also good to have when your working with people you do like too. Even if you don't like participating in a sport due to the school atmosphere it could become a hobby later in life when you can get changed or showered in privacy. Everyone will have a social situation they don't like and a high school is one of the best places do be exposed to these situations because there is a security network from teachers and staff. Learning to deal with uncomfortable social situations is one of the most highly valued life skills in our modern world and the diversity of a high school curriculum, including gym, and social hierarchy is what prepares us best for the real world because it is all very well having high grades if you can't use your knowledge to the best of your own ability or an employers needs because you don't know how to cope socially. Social learning is just as important if not more so as educational studies and gym is a very good way introducing more real world social situations allowing you to learn how to deal with them.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert. I await my opponent's 2nd round argument.",value,Value,,

When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert. I await my opponent's 2nd round argument.",value,Value,,

WOW. my first time as well. this is also going to be very hard because I do not have a lot of time to argue this proposition.  
  
Ok you defined:  
  
Chicken: a domestic fowl bred for flesh or eggs  
Egg: animal reproductive body consisting of an ovum or embryo together with nutritive and protective envelopes  
  
We can use the definition to find out what a chicken is actually considered. The first chicken actually came from two different types of species, the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. These two species of birds produced the first known chicken. Even though you used the creationism approach, it does not say in the Bible God created chickens. It says that God created birds, which does not mean he created chickens but a bird that could eventually create a new species.  
  
You did not define clearly what you considered a chicken. Even though it is a domestic fowl, it could be considered many of the domestic fowls in the world. The word chicken first originated around 1500 in the Middle English era. It is even shown that India had been using a type of fowl for thousands of years before the word originated. But it did not have the title of chicken. The word egg however was first seen in 450 around the Old English era. This also makes the point that because the word egg comes before chicken, the egg came before the chicken.",value,Fact,,

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real.

Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world.

The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert. I await my opponent's 2nd round argument.",value,Value,,

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.

If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert. I await my opponent's 2nd round argument.",value,Fact,,

According to merriam-webster dictionary, the definition of convert is to bring over from one belief to another.

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.  
  
Professor John Brookfield, a specialist in evolutionary genetics at the University of Nottingham, told the UK Press Association this ""The living organism inside the eggshell would have had the same DNA as the chicken it would develop into."" So the chicken had to come first for the egg to be created.",value,Fact,,

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.

If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Ok I know I did not define everything as well as I should have. Thank you also for going easy on me.  
  
If the egg existed before the chicken, how would the egg have hatched into a chicken, without body warmth from a chicken incubating it long enough to hatch? Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Also, if the egg contained the DNA inside it for a chicken before it actually hatched, would that not mean that the essential form of the chicken(by way of a DNA strand) must have existed before the egg? Therefore, would not this train of thought lead one to logically conclude that the chicken came before the egg, because the egg had to be incubated? The egg could not have hatched into a chicken without being laid and incubated by a mother hen. Also, the egg might have been eaten (or otherwise destroyed) by predators if the mother hen had not been around to protect it.  
  
Whether or not the word chicken or egg came first does not mean that there wasn't a chicken and an egg around before the word. English was not the first language. So therefore, a chicken and an egg existed long before the English words were used. Your argument about word origin can then be thrown out.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert. I await my opponent's 2nd round argument.",value,Value,,

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

Hello, welcome to my debate.  
  
Contention 1: Christians without knowledge  
  
If you look at my first video, you will see what I'm talking about. Titled ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", it is exactly that, NONSENSE! The highlights of this video include a woman claiming to be a ""FOOL for Christ"", a man that attempts to heal someone over the phone and fails (as well as making ridiculous screams), several politicians that make nonsense claims, and two men who use a banana to try to prove the existence of God. Simply put, those people are all religious whack jobs who know little to nothing about the truth of Christianity. These are the people that symbolize Christianity in out modern day world. Obviously, the theories and statements made in that video are not in any way tied to Christianity. However, Atheists look at that video and say ""If that's what Christianity is all about, then I'm never going to be a Christian"". In the long run, the people in that video turn people off to Christianity, which gives the Christian religion a black eye.  
  
Contention 2: Personal Experience with Most Christians  
  
The area I live in is a densely Christian area. After some personal encounters with these Christians, I can say that most of them know nothing about Christianity. One question I will always ask somebody who claims to be a Christian is "" Can you proof that God exists"". They tell me ""No, I can't prove it, but there's proof out there. I just have faith"". That statement is what makes Christianity look like a fairytale, because 99.9% of all Christians have no clear proof as to why God and Jesus Christ are real. Therefore, if Christians can't prove the Christian theories to be true, then no Atheists would be willing to convert.  
  
Contention 3: Atheists' Opinions of Christians  
  
My second video pokes fun at religion through comedy. The two actors in that skit is what most people of religion sound like in the perspective of Atheists. Atheists, as I've said before, are very fact and logic based people. When someone who is looking for proof of Christianity wants facts as to why God and Jesus Christ exist and they hear ""The things in the Bible are true because the Bible says the Bible is true..."", they don't buy into it. The fact is, most of the things said in the video sound like a fairytale. Atheists won't buy into it because they are looking for a logical explanation as to why they all are here.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
I have presented my argument as to why Christianity looks like a ridiculous religion because most Christians don't know what they're talking about. The more Christians continue this behavior, the more ridiculous the Christian religion will look. However, if Christians prove their religion is true factually and logically, then there will be a lot of Atheists who ""see the light"" and convert.

Secondly, I know I exist because I am and it is impossible for me to not exist because my existence is what I am right now.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg. Concluding that the first living organism had to come from the form of an egg or embryo.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg. Concluding that the first living organism had to come from the form of an egg or embryo.

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

Let it be known that I am not limiting this debate to the iPod, but I will refer to that as a representative of the MP3 player.  
  
My opponent starts off by talking about how special hearing your favorite song/artist was when you were required to use a CD player. However, why should iPods diminish this ""specialty?"" If you were so pressed to keep this so-called ""magic"" you would limit yourself to how many times you listened to a certain song. You are not bound by any means to listen to a song just because it's on your iPod. Also, if you wanted to go back to the days of when radio was popular, you would simply listen to the radio.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg. Concluding that the first living organism had to come from the form of an egg or embryo.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg. Concluding that the first living organism had to come from the form of an egg or embryo.

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken.

Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg.

I did in fact defend my opening opinion in Round 1 based on what I said in Round 2.  
  
""I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith.""  
  
In my round 2 argument, I posted a link to a video called ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", which depicted the average Christian TV personnel. In that video, there were Christians that believed in God only because of faith. Therefore, I covered the first sentence in my Round 2 argument.  
  
""Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.""  
  
I explained that most Christians don't give proof of the existence of God and Jesus Christ in all three of my contentions. I also stated that Atheists are fact and logic oriented and since Christians don't give proof that Christianity is the superior religion (Which I did explain), Atheists refuse to buy into it.  
  
Therefore, I covered everything I said I was going to cover in my opening opinion statement.  
  
Rebuttal 2: My Opponent's Response  
  
Your response did not fulfill the rules and regulations I set forth in my opening statement.  
  
""2nd Round: An in-depth analysis of your opinion (and reasoning behind your opinion)""  
  
2nd Round was strictly supposed to be you giving your opinion on this subject and reasoning behind you opinion. You were not supposed to respond to what I said, because rebuttals are for 3rd round only.  
  
""3rd round: Rebuttals and conclusion""  
  
Therefore, you did not do what you should've done in the 2nd round.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
My opponent has not fulfilled his requirements for his 2nd round argument due to the fact that he responded to me, which I said wasn't allowed. Likewise, 3rd round is only for rebuttals and a conclusion. Therefore, any argument he makes for his case in the 3rd round is invalid.  
  
I have showed why his 2nd round argument is false by pointing out exactly where I said everything that he claimed I didn't say. I await my opponent's final round statement.",value,Value,,

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

You don't have to look through stacks of albums or wait for the radio to play the song you want. Also, the iPod has made listening to music a non-social event. You see people all the time with those white buds stuck in their ears; dousn't this get rid of the joy of listening to the music with friends and family?  
  
My oponnent also stated that if you wanted to listen to the radio and alternative ways of listening to music, you still can. But I would argue that this option will not be around for long.Already radio stations are being put out of business and artists are no longer offering tangable albums or CD's because of the easy listening iPod and others provide.",value,Value,,

""I think Christianity is looked down upon by Atheists because too many Christians belief in God only because of faith.""  
  
In my round 2 argument, I posted a link to a video called ""Crazy Christian Nonsense"", which depicted the average Christian TV personnel. In that video, there were Christians that believed in God only because of faith. Therefore, I covered the first sentence in my Round 2 argument.  
  
""Atheists are very fact and logic oriented people. Since most Christians don't have proof for the existence of God or Jesus Christ, Atheists look at the idea of Christianity as a fairytale rather than a theory with potential to be true.""  
  
I explained that most Christians don't give proof of the existence of God and Jesus Christ in all three of my contentions. I also stated that Atheists are fact and logic oriented and since Christians don't give proof that Christianity is the superior religion (Which I did explain), Atheists refuse to buy into it.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible.

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

Third: by your definition, everything MUST exist, if i say it does. i perceive it does, so by your definition and arguments, the original statement you made is false. a negative burden is simply to disprove the original statement, and through your arguments, i have. Descartes objectivity has come into question, so i dont even believe your resources are credible. simply because one says something does not make it true. i urge you to contend me on this point.  
  
on your summary, i would argue that even though we are part of a higher force, we alone cannot stand, cannot exist.",value,Fact,,

The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg.

Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

Let me put one thing on the table: If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, it would be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg.  
  
With that point, the egg must have come first before the chicken. The chicken came from two different types of species of birds. These two birds came together to create the first domestic chicken. There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg.

Let me explain to you what really happened.  
  
KFC was an idea that would be hatched soon, as they put it themselves out of a compliment to their work with chicken. But their name was too close to JFK, so they felt threatened by it. They went to their food basement, and spent a few years designing a way to combine bullets with fried chicken. Finally, one of them thought of an idea (what if we could figure out how to design a bullet that would pass through a person's body system as food would, allowing it to enter places it normally could not have, then when the food covering the bullet dissolves the human body rejects the foreign object. By achieving this novel experiment, the bullet will enter JFK's back (to symbolize that chicken's got back, not just breasts), so the breaded bullet is then trapped in the esophagus, after the bread dissolved the stomach saw it had a foreign object so it rejected the bullet back up, but because the person that created the bullet was a mad scientist they made sure that upon dissolving there would be a chain reaction that would launch the bullet back to its regular speed, if not more, to pierce his throat like they cut the chicken's throat, then causing collateral damage to unintended victims.  
  
The only reason why they never could find the second bullet is because it was KFC on the same exact day wanting to assassinate JFK all because of the competition between them.",value,Testimony,,

I thank Ragnar for taking up this debate.  
  
The cornerstone of his argument is the use of language. He claims for the U.S.A to go to War with China, all people of each nation must be in attendance. However, consider the following sentences:  
  
'The United States went to war (war in this case meaning an armed conflict) with Iraq'  
  
'The United States has entered peace talks with North Korea'  
  
In the first sentence, it doesn't imply every American citizen was armed and sent to Iraq to fight, nor does it imply every Iraqi citizen was armed to fight against the incoming Americans. It implies the two nations in fact went to war. In this context, representatives of the United States (Namely soldiers and the government) were at war with Iraq. The United States is not a general abbreviation for the people of the United States in most contexts, exceptions are:  
  
'The United States was upset with the 2008 election outcome'  
  
In this context, it is clear the people of the United States were upset, as it implied emotion, and as the U.S.A is technically an inanimate idea, it implies the people within the U.S.A, or the majority, were angry.  
  
Context is the key to this. As the context implies no emotion, it implies that someone representing the states is involved rather than everyone.  
  
To further my case, the definition I gave for the United States was   http://en.wikipedia.org...  . According to this, it says [the very first sentence] ""The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district."" . This means the U.S.A isn't an animate object, meaning it can't go to a War concert with the People Republic China, also an inanimate object. Instead it must send representatives of the State, as must China.  
  
So, these resolution implies that both States (PROC and USA) should attend the War concert, however as they are not animate objects, they must indeed send representatives, such as Hu Jintao or Bill Clinton.

There DNA mutated to form the commonly known chicken of this day. Eggs were around long before the chicken first appeared.  
  
Some animal other than a chicken laid the first chicken egg which contained the first chicken. In this case the chicken egg came before the chicken. Scientists use the theory of punctuated equilibrium which says that the actual speciation of an organism from its ancestral species is usually the result of many mutations combined with new geographical surroundings, called cladogenesis. This shows that the chicken had to first have its DNA in an embryo that developed into its true form.  
  
Finally because you did not define egg at the beginning to be from a chicken, the egg could have been from any species of animal or bird. Dinosaur eggs have been around longer than chicken eggs, you can look at fossil evidence for that claim. For an animal to change, its genetics would have to change also and this is impossible. Therefore the change would have to take place as an embryo or egg. So the first chicken was most likely spawned in prehistoric times as an embryo/egg. Concluding that the first living organism had to come from the form of an egg or embryo.

Let me explain to you what really happened.  
  
KFC was an idea that would be hatched soon, as they put it themselves out of a compliment to their work with chicken. But their name was too close to JFK, so they felt threatened by it. They went to their food basement, and spent a few years designing a way to combine bullets with fried chicken. Finally, one of them thought of an idea (what if we could figure out how to design a bullet that would pass through a person's body system as food would, allowing it to enter places it normally could not have, then when the food covering the bullet dissolves the human body rejects the foreign object. By achieving this novel experiment, the bullet will enter JFK's back (to symbolize that chicken's got back, not just breasts), so the breaded bullet is then trapped in the esophagus, after the bread dissolved the stomach saw it had a foreign object so it rejected the bullet back up, but because the person that created the bullet was a mad scientist they made sure that upon dissolving there would be a chain reaction that would launch the bullet back to its regular speed, if not more, to pierce his throat like they cut the chicken's throat, then causing collateral damage to unintended victims.  
  
The only reason why they never could find the second bullet is because it was KFC on the same exact day wanting to assassinate JFK all because of the competition between them.",value,Fact,,

Let me explain to you what really happened.  
  
KFC was an idea that would be hatched soon, as they put it themselves out of a compliment to their work with chicken. But their name was too close to JFK, so they felt threatened by it. They went to their food basement, and spent a few years designing a way to combine bullets with fried chicken.

Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate?

To state that any attempts to pursue justice, equality, peace and love are futile is similar to watching the bath water in a tub going down the drain. Why bother plugging the drain? The water will eventually seep through the plug and evaporate into the air leaving an empty tub anyway. Why slow down the inevitable?  
In a larger sense there probably isn't going to be a moment in time when every human being will experience peace and tranquility at the exact same time. Personal serenity is attainable by every individual, if we work for it. You can be in heaven right where you sit, or you can be in hell, the choice is yours!  
Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate?

Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning.

No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right?

Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",policy,Fact,,

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

To state that any attempts to pursue justice, equality, peace and love are futile is similar to watching the bath water in a tub going down the drain. Why bother plugging the drain? The water will eventually seep through the plug and evaporate into the air leaving an empty tub anyway. Why slow down the inevitable?  
In a larger sense there probably isn't going to be a moment in time when every human being will experience peace and tranquility at the exact same time. Personal serenity is attainable by every individual, if we work for it. You can be in heaven right where you sit, or you can be in hell, the choice is yours!  
Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate?

To state that any attempts to pursue justice, equality, peace and love are futile is similar to watching the bath water in a tub going down the drain. Why bother plugging the drain? The water will eventually seep through the plug and evaporate into the air leaving an empty tub anyway. Why slow down the inevitable?  
In a larger sense there probably isn't going to be a moment in time when every human being will experience peace and tranquility at the exact same time. Personal serenity is attainable by every individual, if we work for it. You can be in heaven right where you sit, or you can be in hell, the choice is yours!  
Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate?

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

To state that any attempts to pursue justice, equality, peace and love are futile is similar to watching the bath water in a tub going down the drain. Why bother plugging the drain? The water will eventually seep through the plug and evaporate into the air leaving an empty tub anyway. Why slow down the inevitable?  
In a larger sense there probably isn't going to be a moment in time when every human being will experience peace and tranquility at the exact same time.

Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate?

Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

I thank my opponent for this grammatically engaging debate  
  
""To be ""At war"" with someone, does not mean that you personally are shooting them. It means that someone who holds your allegiance is. Taxes are the mechanism by which the entire nation is at war with Iraq.  
  
--> Partially true. The citizens of a state elect representatives to government. The choose these people to represent them in domestic, national and international affairs. They put trust in these people to make these decisions. If they choose to go to war, they are representing the people (or the majority) in their decision. If they go to war, they send representatives who fulfil the given agenda. In this case, it's kill people.  
  
Furthermore, taxes are the mechanism in which everyone in the United States would take part, paying for the various expenses of such an endeavour as going to War with China.  
  
""The fact that this linguistic sloppiness exist does not automatically make it correct. Entering peace talks, unlike ""entering a war,"" does imply personal talking, and the media's usage is simply incorrect on this account or at best imprecise. Debating resolutions, on the other hand, require high precision.""  
  
--> Again, the United re sending representatives of the U.S.A to these talks, and the way in which every citizen contributes is through taxation for the bill involved.  
  
""the people"" can have no literal meaning but ""the totality of people."" Majorities are irrelevant. The United States was not angry about the election outcome. Certain segments within it were.""  
  
--> The United states was a generalisation for the majority of people within it. If my opponent attempts to use this sentence against me, again, this is implying emotion, something an inanimate object cannot express  
  
""In other words, the resolution is meaningless and impossible by the definition you have just sourced. That does not further your case. Sending representatives is an ALTERNATIVE TO the resolution, not a FULFILLMENT OF the resolution.""  
  
--> The fulfilment of my interpretation of the resolution is sending representatives. The fulfilment to YOUR interpretation of the resolution is the taxation each American citizen would foot.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.","
  
  
  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

The water will eventually seep through the plug and evaporate into the air leaving an empty tub anyway. Why slow down the inevitable?  
In a larger sense there probably isn't going to be a moment in time when every human being will experience peace and tranquility at the exact same time. Personal serenity is attainable by every individual, if we work for it. You can be in heaven right where you sit, or you can be in hell, the choice is yours!  
Crime has existed ever since Eve broke the law and ate the forbidden apple. Failure of governments to regulate certain socially condemned behaviors is to invite chaos and discord in proportions that we could never even imagine.  
Human beings are not born with the concepts of racism and prejudice. These are learned behaviors that are taught to us by society. When we come to realize that these behaviors are wrong then we can begin to learn new, better behaviors. We do not have to be weighed down by the dead weight of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate. Once we learn how to do that then we can soar and feel the peace and serenity that we crave for. The social ills of this world will decrease in direct proportion to the number of human beings that take to heart the concepts expressed by Saint Francis of Assisi.  
What value is there in debating on whether or not the cup of life is half full because of justice, equality, peace and love; or is half empty because of injustice, inequality, chaos and hate? What matters is what I am personally doing to ensure that I am filling the cup! Remember, every mighty river of this world starts with just a drop of water!",value,Value,,

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Policy,,

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:

  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan.

  What are real facts? They are facts that have documented sources to back them up (form legitimate creators of the source).  
  My opponent admits that   ""it's mostly just cut and pasting things from other sources.""   which would suggest that the debates here are essentially efficient plagiarizing as opposed to being   ""all about who the best BS artist is"".  The reason behind pro's assertion is that   ""You can ""prove"" anything with enough twisting of words and facts along with some links to some bias website that confirms what you say.""   However, he fails to prove that this is BSing. Instead of BSing I would say that this is documenting efficiently for the victory in a debate.  The second, and in my view inferior, line of reasoning that my opponent uses to reach their conclusion is that   ""There's very little thought as to what goes into a debate and it's mostly just cut and pasting things from other sources.""   If the sources that are cut and pasted form have truth and not BS then is this not disproving the proposition?  In conclusion, the debates here are, according to my opponent's reasoning, a series of effective and accurate copy paste edits but not a series of BSing.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

""To be ""At war"" with someone, does not mean that you personally are shooting them. It means that someone who holds your allegiance is. Taxes are the mechanism by which the entire nation is at war with Iraq.  
  
--> Partially true. The citizens of a state elect representatives to government. The choose these people to represent them in domestic, national and international affairs. They put trust in these people to make these decisions. If they choose to go to war, they are representing the people (or the majority) in their decision. If they go to war, they send representatives who fulfil the given agenda. In this case, it's kill people.  
  
Furthermore, taxes are the mechanism in which everyone in the United States would take part, paying for the various expenses of such an endeavour as going to War with China.  
  
""The fact that this linguistic sloppiness exist does not automatically make it correct.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",42386,Evolution shouldn't be widely accepted... yet,It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win.,"
  
  
  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Fact,,

Also, I listen to much different music than my family, and they DON'T want to hear my music. When I'm jogging, neighbors don't want to hear Slipknot at 3 in the morning. And radio stations went out of business in the CD-player era, so this is non-unique. And what major artist isn't putting out physical copies of songs anymore? I personally have an iPod touch, and I still buy CD's. I actually bought three last night at a concert I went to. Also, note my opponent's use of the phrase ""easy listening iPod and others provide."" EXACTLY! I want it to be easy for me to listen to music. You ignore all the advantages I claim.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",42386,Evolution shouldn't be widely accepted... yet,Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.,"
  
  
  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

First of all. My opponent seems to be pulling this debate in the direction of whether iPods are good or not. And that is not what the debate is about at all. I personally love my iPod. I think easy listening it great. But that is not what this debate is about. It is about whether or not the iPod takes value out of the time spent listening. I would say that it does simply because it makes it easier. Would you value a painting more if you had to paint it yourself? Yes. Would you value money more if you had to earn it yourself? Yes. And would you value the time you spend listening to music if you had to do more than just press a few buttons. I think yes.  
  
My point here is that as easy as the iPod has made listening to music, it has also devalued it in our own eyes. It had taken away the rarity of music and thus has taken away a bit of the magic. Thank you---",fact,Fact,,

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",42386,Evolution shouldn't be widely accepted... yet,Where then could the dinosaur have come from?,"
  
  
  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Value,,

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.  
     
  Thank you.

  Thank you, Pro, for reminding me why I don't have cable.  My opponent's arguments can be broken down like this:  1. Ghosts are shown on TV shows.  2. Everything shown on TV is real.  3. Therefore, Ghosts are real.  The first premise is not in dispute, but the second definitely is. He explains his curiously horrible second premise with a sub-argument:  1. If TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news, then everything shown on TV is true.  2. TV broadcasts truthful, unbiased news.  3. Therefore, everything shown on TV is true.  Even leniently ignoring the ""truthful, unbiased"" bit (I'm looking at you, FOX), this argument still crumbles.  The first premise of this argument is an error in inductive reasoning. It assumes that because a (relatively small) portion of everything shown on TV is true, then literally everything shown on TV is true. Logically, we know this is not necessarily true, as such a limited testing group cannot be extrapolated to account for everything (ie, Every girl I've ever met has been single; this must mean EVERY girl in THE ENTIRE WORLD is single, right? No...). And realistically, we know this is not true, because we know TV is a primary source for much fiction.  In conclusion, vote Con, or I will lose all faith in humanity. ",value,Testimony,,

  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.

This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.

  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment.","
  
  
  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

First of all. My opponent seems to be pulling this debate in the direction of whether iPods are good or not. And that is not what the debate is about at all. I personally love my iPod. I think easy listening it great. But that is not what this debate is about. It is about whether or not the iPod takes value out of the time spent listening. I would say that it does simply because it makes it easier. Would you value a painting more if you had to paint it yourself? Yes. Would you value money more if you had to earn it yourself? Yes. And would you value the time you spend listening to music if you had to do more than just press a few buttons. I think yes.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

Democracy to thrive impose serious responsibility on the citizens to participate in the sacred duty of Voting to elect leaders,who govern them. In many leading democracies the percentage of eligible voter participation is declining with the result that the winning candidates get away with a minority of the total vote percentage. This is the result of citizens in democracies not doing their sacred duty which may in turn result in bad governance. I feel that penal provisions for violation of this fundamental duty by citizens must be made punishable,though freedom is the essence of democracy.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T.

  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.

In many leading democracies the percentage of eligible voter participation is declining with the result that the winning candidates get away with a minority of the total vote percentage. This is the result of citizens in democracies not doing their sacred duty which may in turn result in bad governance. I feel that penal provisions for violation of this fundamental duty by citizens must be made punishable,though freedom is the essence of democracy. Freedom does not mean remaining passive spectator and being lethargic to go to the polling stations and vote. To protect his freedom, the voter has to pay a price by doing his duty of Voting for his choice candidate.",value,Fact,,

First of all. My opponent seems to be pulling this debate in the direction of whether iPods are good or not. And that is not what the debate is about at all. I personally love my iPod. I think easy listening it great. But that is not what this debate is about. It is about whether or not the iPod takes value out of the time spent listening. I would say that it does simply because it makes it easier. Would you value a painting more if you had to paint it yourself? Yes. Would you value money more if you had to earn it yourself? Yes. And would you value the time you spend listening to music if you had to do more than just press a few buttons. I think yes.  
  
My point here is that as easy as the iPod has made listening to music, it has also devalued it in our own eyes. It had taken away the rarity of music and thus has taken away a bit of the magic. Thank you---",value,Value,,

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

  Evolution is the most fact based theory and has logical premises and conclusions, which should therefore make it accepted. Just because something has not been proven fact does not mean it is not true nor logical.  
  Let’s use an example:  
  Say there are two fighters, Michael and Jordan.  
  Michael is stronger, faster, has had more training, and has a far better record than Jordan. Jordan is slow, weak, has had little training, and has been defeated by men that are worse fighters than Michael. Even though it is not a proven fact that Michael will defeat Jordan in a fight, it is logical from the factual information gathered that Michael will defeat Jordan.  
  Evolution unlike this fight is not as subjective of a matter. It does not rely on chance that it may be wrong unlike a fight where a lucky punch could win. Evolution is simply supported by factual evidence and is logical so it should therefore be accepted.  
  Fossil Record   
  A large amount of creatures that no longer exist today have existed in the past and have been found through fossilization. It can also be found that certain species existed later than others, but do not exist now.  
  For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Cretaceous Period but not before. Where then could the dinosaur have come from? If we do not accept evolution as true then the T. Rex must have always existed and then died out, but we know this to be untrue. Evolution provides a logical answer that certain genetics in creatures were dominant, allowing them to survive. As these genetics continued to be passed on because they increased the survival of a species, and the dinosaurs without the genetics were more likely to die off, an entire new species eventually   evolved   out of these passed down genetics.  
  So in order for a new species to exist a genetic mutation must occur and be dominant in an already existing species. Over time as this genetic mutation begins occurring frequently amongst a species, a new species is created.  
  Adaptation   
  Adaptation occurs when a species evolves to better survive in its environment. Birds are a primary example of this. Depending on the ecosystem a bird is in, their beaks may be different in order to better suit their needs. This is because genetic mutations which allowed a certain species to better survive became dominant eventually evolving the bird to better survive in its environment. Birds who live near rivers may have long beaks that are good for snatching fish out of the water. Birds that live in tropical forests may have long, thick curved beaks used for eating fruit.  
     
  I think both of these are good examples supporting evolution, which has solid premises and a logical conclusion. This being said, evolution should therefore be accepted in order to further scientific progress and knowledge.

And would you value the time you spend listening to music if you had to do more than just press a few buttons. I think yes.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.

In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other.

""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

What I want to emphasize is that many voters are not doing their sacred once in 4/5 years duty of voting and electing leaders.  
In democracy we should realize the value of vote is the essence of my argument.  
Penal provisions for Not Voting in my view are to remind the voters that they have a duty too to fulfill so that their democracy flourishes .

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States.

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience.

If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi.

[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]  
  
~~~  
  
My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.

Thank you for creating this debate.

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]  
  
~~~  
  
""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]  
  
~~~  
  
""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]  
  
~~~  
  
My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.","
  
Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",policy,Fact,,

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

The long arm of the law is not a process reform. People need to want to vote, and currently there's nothing worth voting for. Converting over to a run off election could certainly help get more people involved and give a voice to those who previously did not have a voice. But, honestly, you don't fix a ""lack of interest"" with a gun to your temple.  
  
Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it.  
  
Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote. The choices aren't that great and for the most part voting doesn't change the outcome. For example, did you know that the voting rate is better in Cuba and in Saddam's Iraq than it is in the US, and they only had one party systems... and similar provisions to your rules.  
  
We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should. Forcing people to the polls does not make magical democracy fairies come around to fix all the problem. Random disinterested people vote when they need to vote, and don't when they don't.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",36089,Should abortion be made illegal?,Let us define abortion eh?,"
  
Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",policy,Fact,,

""Well duh.""  
My opponent appears to concede the debate.  
  
His ""and/or"" arguments are irrelevant.  
  
""My opponent needs to prove that usernames cannot be changed at will.""  
I do not. This burden is absurd, and the resolution can be affirmed without said proof.  
  
""Note that it does not say 'successfully.'""  
Again, this is irrelevant.  
  
""No, you cannot have 1 1/2 members. What does my opponent mean by 'number?'""  
  
My mistake, the intended meaning was ""whole number"".

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]  
  
~~~  
  
""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]  
  
~~~  
  
My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

  I accept your fun debate! I am an anime fan as well and have watched Ouran High School Host Club a couple times over.  Replies to Questions:  ""And, how are they supposed to do their brotherly love act if there's only one?""  In the Host Club Hikaru and Kaoru play the part of a the ""forbidden love"" characters with their apparent sexual attraction toward each other. They have shown the ability to portray heartbreaking acts shown in various scenes in the show such as episode 4 with the basketball game scene. I believe even if they were separate they would still be able to fulfill their role acting as heartbroken brothers forcefully separated from each other. That would still get their clients to swoon.  ""  They have never had a fight (except that one episode, but it was fake!!!) and do you think they ever will?""  I deem it possible. They have had issues with each other, but not enough so that they ever had a legitimate fight. I think it is possible and will happen eventually. I have never read the manga so if they did have a fight after the events shown in the television show I do not know about it.  ""They don't want to leave each other, and they never will, if you think having only Hikaru and no Kaoru (or vice versa), do you know how they would act without each other?""  As stated before, I think they would still be able to fulfill their role in the club at least to an extent. They have proven that they can be apart and still have self-fulfillment as they both shown in episode 16 when Koaru deliberately sent Hikaru away on a date with Haruhi. Hikaru has shown in that episode and occasionally from that point forward that he could be happy with someone else.  Concluding Argument:  While having Hikaru and Koaru separated does seem unorthodox I believe it would work. If I were with only one brother (and if I were homosexual if a romantic relationship is implied) I think they would still be happy assuming the other twin in also being emotionally occupied with an alternate relationship. It is proven in episode 16 that Hikaru has romantic feelings toward Haruhi and seems to be able to be happy with her without Koaru present. Therefore, it is possible for them to be separate and happy as well as fulfill their role in the club.

I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

The long arm of the law is not a process reform. People need to want to vote, and currently there's nothing worth voting for. Converting over to a run off election could certainly help get more people involved and give a voice to those who previously did not have a voice. But, honestly, you don't fix a ""lack of interest"" with a gun to your temple.  
  
Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it.  
  
Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote. The choices aren't that great and for the most part voting doesn't change the outcome. For example, did you know that the voting rate is better in Cuba and in Saddam's Iraq than it is in the US, and they only had one party systems... and similar provisions to your rules.  
  
We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should. Forcing people to the polls does not make magical democracy fairies come around to fix all the problem. Random disinterested people vote when they need to vote, and don't when they don't.

All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Politics is a messy business. People with money finance campaigns, and in return, they expect those politicians whose campaigns they financed to help them out a bit.

There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.

Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it.  
  
Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote. The choices aren't that great and for the most part voting doesn't change the outcome. For example, did you know that the voting rate is better in Cuba and in Saddam's Iraq than it is in the US, and they only had one party systems... and similar provisions to your rules.  
  
We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should. Forcing people to the polls does not make magical democracy fairies come around to fix all the problem. Random disinterested people vote when they need to vote, and don't when they don't.  
  
Non-voting in elections is near the bottom of problems with government.",value,Value,,

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem.

Thank you for creating this debate.  
  
I will attempt to refute the resolution that compared to college, universities aren't useful.

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]  
  
~~~  
  
""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]  
  
~~~  
  
""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]  
  
~~~  
  
My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

That, unfortunately, does not hold true. To fix the situation, we must reform campaign finance. No more will we be a society where the wealthy and powerful make the rules while the everyman has barely any say. We should not stand for this.  
  
There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed. I am not advocating any specific way, I am simply noting that there is a problem and some type of reform is necessary to fix it. For the better of our political process, for the better of our country, and for the better of this world.",value,Value,,

[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby.

[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Classify the type of sentences in a debate,"Classify the type of sentences in a debate into five categories: Policy, Value, Fact, Testimony, Reference","text, classification, debate, argument mining",36089,Should abortion be made illegal?,So the basic premise of the first point falls flat.,"
  
Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should.

The long arm of the law is not a process reform. People need to want to vote, and currently there's nothing worth voting for.

Politics is a messy business. People with money finance campaigns, and in return, they expect those politicians whose campaigns they financed to help them out a bit.  
No more should this occur. These are not democratic ideals. This country was founded on the notion that every taxpayer should have the same amount of say in government.

There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",value,Fact,,

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States.

Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

The long arm of the law is not a process reform. People need to want to vote, and currently there's nothing worth voting for.

But, honestly, you don't fix a ""lack of interest"" with a gun to your temple.  
  
Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it.  
  
Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote.

We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]

""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]

""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]

My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

Alright, so here we are debating over the subject: Should abortion be made illegal.  
  
Let us define abortion eh?  
  
Abortion - the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.  
  
I'll assume illegal is common enough that it doesn't need a definition.  
  
My opponent seems to make three main points in his statement above.  
  
Firstly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is murder and the constitution declares murder illegal in every way  
  
Secondly, that abortion violates the constitution as abortion is a form of cruel and unusual punishment on the aborted child.  
  
Third, the commonly used ""the child could grow up to cure cancer"" argument.  
  
Now to deal with those, as a commenter pointed out and as i would have myself, the constitution does not actually mention the illegality of murder. That's a law sure, but not every law is contained in the US constitution. So the basic premise of the first point falls flat. I'm sure it'll come back later though and I'll have to explain the difference between murder and abortion, but I'll give pro the honor of telling me I misinterpreted his point and am using semantics to try and confuse things.  
  
The second point, I think this is farily obvious but the fetus isn't being punished in an abortion. That is not the intent. No one has an abortion because they're mad at their unborn child and wants to torture them. You're sort of stretching the definitions of things to suit you, so let us define punishment!  
  
Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.  
  
Thank you to my opponent for this debate and good luck to all.",value,Fact,,

Punishment - The infliction or imposition of penalty as retribution for an offense.  
  
People have abortions for a variety of reasons, but none are for a retribution against the fetus. That's just a tad bit silly to imagine.  
  
Finally, the 'might cure cancer' argument. If you want a mathematical counter, I can say 'or they might become Hitler' but I'll simply say to make something illegal simply because of the tiny probability of a certain consequence is ridiculous. It's trying to control minutia that truly are uncontrolable.  
  
That aborted fetus will NOT grow up to cure cancer, I can absolutely guarantee it, because I know it'll grow up to be dead. It was aborted. That is what it is.  
There are billions of others, if you look at many of our great scientific rockstars, I'll bet you never realized that there are always a handful of other people independently reaching similar conclusions to them at around the same time. What you will do is not predestined before birth so much as it is grown through life. So aborting a fetus is not going to rob the world of the cure to cancer anymore than it will prevent the next Hitler.  
  
BOP was not determined, but generally I assume it to lie on pro.  
I'll still pitch in the mother's right to her own body however, as she should fully well have the option of removing a parasitic being from her body before it causes 9 months of medical and financial havoc and 18 years + of legal and financial trouble if she so desires.

Thank you for creating this debate.

""...college teaches you how to screw in a light bulb, while university teaches you the history of one.""  
  
[This analogy is very broad and for the most part incorrect. What you learn at a college or university depends not on that institution but what any specific person is studying at that institution. For instance, if I wanted to get a degree in auto mechanics that was offered at a university would you argue that this degree would teach me nothing about repairing cars and would only teach me about the history of automobiles?]  
  
~~~  
  
""University isn't practical, its theoretical. It doesn't set you up with a career, it sets you up with a hobby. I think the ideal university student is that of a person 50+ because one can develop a new interest or fascination that they can than gain self-satisfaction, where in earlier life, they really couldn't.""  
  
[Harvard University is one of, if not the, best law school in the United States. Getting a degree in law from here virtually guarantees that you will be sought after for employment by numerous law firms. Also, the idea that a younger person can not gain self satisfaction through a university is absurd.]  
  
~~~  
  
""With early life, a nineteen year old university student is worried about everything but gaining self- satisfaction. They are worried about passing the upcoming test, remembering the study group on Tuesday and buying beer on Friday.""  
  
[I ask my opponent to explain his view that passing a test would not make a person satisfied with themselves. Studying is merely a means used to gain that satisfaction. I also ask my opponent to explain his view that buying beer for a party is a worrisome activity.]  
  
~~~  
  
My Contention:  
University is a title used to describe an institute of higher education and is synonymous with the words College, Institute (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Academy (United States Military Academy), Union (Cooper Union), Conservatory (New England Conservatory), and School (Juilliard School).  
  
All of the above institutions are considered colleges and simply because a place has a different title does not mean it offers a dissimilar educational experience. As an example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great place to get a degree in engineering, but so is the University of Michigan [1]. A title only changes how one refers to a thing in this instance, not the style of teaching.

This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed.

I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.  
  
What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.

No more will we be a society where the wealthy and powerful make the rules while the everyman has barely any say. We should not stand for this.  
  
There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed. I am not advocating any specific way, I am simply noting that there is a problem and some type of reform is necessary to fix it.

The long arm of the law is not a process reform. People need to want to vote, and currently there's nothing worth voting for.

But, honestly, you don't fix a ""lack of interest"" with a gun to your temple.  
  
Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it.  
  
Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote.

For example, did you know that the voting rate is better in Cuba and in Saddam's Iraq than it is in the US, and they only had one party systems... and similar provisions to your rules.  
  
We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should.

I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.  
  
What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.

Politics is a messy business. People with money finance campaigns, and in return, they expect those politicians whose campaigns they financed to help them out a bit.  
No more should this occur. These are not democratic ideals. This country was founded on the notion that every taxpayer should have the same amount of say in government. That, unfortunately, does not hold true. To fix the situation, we must reform campaign finance. No more will we be a society where the wealthy and powerful make the rules while the everyman has barely any say. We should not stand for this.  
  
There is also another problem with campaign finance as it stands. He who has the most money to spend on a campaign is most likely to be more successful. Take Ross Peroe, for example. The only time in recent history when a third-party candidate got an appreciable amount of the vote. Why did he do so well? It is widely believe to be his wealth that helped him here. This should not happen. A person's wealth will not help him/her lead this country, so there is no reason his/her wealth should help win an election. Reform could obviously fix this problem. Perhaps candidates could have limits of how much personal wealth could be spent campaigning. That is one of many ways that problem could be fixed. I am not advocating any specific way, I am simply noting that there is a problem and some type of reform is necessary to fix it.

""I will stand by my position by saying that yes, a degree in auto mechanics at university would be more theoretical than practical, hands on experience...""  
  
[My opponent is arguing that the auto mechanics curriculum at a university would not include hands on experience working with cars without providing evidence that shows that in universities hands on experience is not used to teach.]  
  
""...because in my opinion, university aren't for people who are interested in a trade, but for those interested in the social sciences or the humanities.""  
  
[An opinion without evidence is only an unsubstantiated claim. As the Pro side of this debate my opponent has the burden of proof to show that universities are only for those interested in social sciences and humanities. Even if my opponent were to try and substantiate this claim here is proof that more than just these subjects of study are offered and widely respected at many universities:  
  
*Harvard University School of Business offers case based study [1] and their alumni work in a variety of trade based fields. [2]  
*Michigan Ross School of Business uses a combination of course work, class projects, and experimental learning to teach. [3]  
*Oxford University offers courses in a much wider variety than those of the social sciences and humanities, including those involving a trade. [4]  
  
From my interpretation of my opponent's statements he states that universities do not offer courses that teach trade fields which I have dis-proven.]  
~~~  
""I should have been more specific. Depending on the discipline in which one is interested in gaining a degree, university is an invaluable resource. (Ie: Law, Medicine, Business, etc) It depends upon the field, as to whether one should attend college or university.""  
  
[So now it is practical in situations such as obtaining a law or medical degree, but not in other fields. I again say that the fields offered by an institute of higher education do not depend on what title the founders of that institution gave it and my opponent has yet to refute that claim and provide evidence to support his position.]  
~~~  
""What I mean by this is that while it gives the student short term satisfaction, it doesn't provide long term satisfaction.""  
  
[I would hardly say that passing tests only provides short term satisfaction as in many college courses tests make up a majority of the grade. Therefore passing tests would correlate to passing courses, which correlates to earning degrees. Earning a college degree is something that usually provides satisfaction for an individual.]  
~~~  
""...when one is a teenager, one isn't able to fully appreciate the knowledge being professed due to other seemingly more important priorities.""  
  
[This statement is a generalization. Simply because a statement applies to a part does not mean that it also applies to the whole. My opponent needs evidence to support this claim or it is an empty one. Appreciation of information is not a requirement to gain satisfaction from it and whether or not someone appreciates information does not affect its overall quality and usefulness.]  
~~~  
""In closing, the difference between these types of institutions are that of content...""

This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.

This is Christopher McHugh's version of the Ontological arugment, and it goes like this:  
  
1) God's existence is either logically impossible or logically necessary.  
2) God's existence is not logically impossible.  
3) Therefore, God necessarily exists.  
  
Premise 1 is true because the definition of God does not allow for contingency; it either necessarily exists or it necessarily doesn't exist.  
  
Premise 2 is true because it is possible to define God using only negative properties; such properties are necessarily logically compatible. For example:  
  
1) God is not contingent.  
  
2) God is not reliant on anything else.  
  
3) God is not subject to contingent law, such as laws of physics that don't apply in every possible world.  
  
4) God is not natural.  
  
5) God is not any sort of abstract entity.  
  
6) God is not spatiotemporal.  
  
7) God is not finite.  
  
8) God is not deficient in any sense.  
  
These characteristics not only show that God's existence is logically possible, but also that this argument cannot be parodied, which is how atheists usually deal with ontological arguments. This logic can be used to show that an evil godlike being exists, and so we would need additional arguments, such as the argument from the Resurrection, to show that God is the Christian God. But this argument cannot show that something that isn't godlike exists. It is foolproof, and it proves the existence of God.
