            <p><strong>Sentence type description</strong></p>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Policy: </strong>This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like “should” and “ought to.”
It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.</p>
                <p>Example: They should not be allowed to contact anyone (other than the debtor him/herself) more than once.</p>
                <p><strong>Value: </strong>This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.</p>
                <p>Example: That would be a starting point that can be expanded on as the system is fine tuned.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact: </strong>This refers to an objective proposition “expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations.” A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.</p>
                <p>Example: Recently, courts have held that debt collectors can escape 1692i’s venue provisions entirely by pursuing debt collection through arbitration instead.</p>
                <p><strong>Testimony: </strong>This refers to an objective sentence about the author’s personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases.</p>
                <p>Example: A neighbor who has since moved away has had her debts turned over to collection agencies.</p>
                <p><strong>Reference: </strong>This refers to a reference to a source of objective evidence. It is typically a citation or a URL of a published work from a renowned source.</p>
                <p>Example: http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201309 cfpb agencybrief 12-cv-04057.pdf</p>
                <p>Note: All the definition and examples are cited from paper https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1257.pdf</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Example HIT:</strong></p>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Debate Topic: </strong>Dane Cook's stand-up is overrated and not funny</p>
                <p><strong>Classification Target Sentence: </strong>Dane Cook is a stand-up comedian whose popularity remains an enigma.</p>
                <p><strong>Type: </strong>Value</p>
