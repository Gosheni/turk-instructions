        "Answer.additional_comments":"I feel that this task is a bit under-paid. It takes 20 seconds for each round so that's 25 rounds in order to get paid. That's 3 rounds a minute - 8 minutes total. for 30 cents; and that's not counting to read the rules, or to try to do more rounds. Which I did 27 more rounds than the 25. Other than that, it was a really fun game. Good luck with your research.",
