The study also found the reading skills gap between children from lower-income and higher-income families has grown &#44; and proficiency varies considerably across states . Students in all but six states have improved reading proficiency &#44; according to the report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation &#44; which used reading scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress &#44; also known as the Nation 's Report Card &#44; to compare reading skills of fourth-graders in 2013 and 2003 . Maryland &#44; the District of Columbia and Rhode Island saw the biggest gains &#44; while reading levels declined in Alaska &#44; Michigan &#44; South Dakota and West Virginia . Reading proficiency remained level in Connecticut &#44; which had the highest percentage of fourth-graders reading proficiently in 2003 &#44; and in Montana . Still &#44; the range of reading skills across the states was striking .

Climate change is n't just about warming temperatures and rising sea levels . It also sets in motion complex consequences that may have unforeseen impacts on ecosystems and human health . Research shows that climate change alters patterns of disease transmission . But for this paper &#44; the researchers wanted to focus on another affliction : snakebites . ' Snakebites &#44; ' said lead author Luis Fernando Chaves &#44; an ecologist at the Nagasaki University Institute of Tropical Medicine in Japan &#44; ' do n't get the attention they deserve &#44; even though they are a major problem . ' After all &#44; snakebites affect 2.5 million people around the world annually &#44; and 400&#44;000 of those people suffer serious medical consequences ( such as nerve damage or amputations ) and 85&#44;000 of them will die .,,100000000000000000000000000000000000001000001000100000000000000100000000000000000000000001011000000000000000000001000100100000000000000000000000000010000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000,Submit,,

The U.S. toy industry is expected to have its strongest year in at least a decade after several years of kids choosing videogames and mobile apps over Barbie and stuffed bears . Annual toy sales are projected to rise 6.2 percent to $ 19.9 billion in 2015 &#44; according to The NPD Group Inc. &#44; a market research firm that tracks about 80 percent of the U.S. toy market . That 's up from a 4 percent increase last year &#44; and the biggest increase in at least 10 years since the group has tracked toys using its current system . The increase factors in brisk sales during the final quarter of this year &#44; when sales are expected to rise 5 percent to $ 9.6 billion &#44; a stronger pace than last year 's 3.6 percent gain . The growth is being fueled by increasing popularity of collectibles &#44; toys based on Hollywood blockbuster films and better technology that allows toys to do things like talk back to children . It comes after sales slowed and sometimes declined in the past 10 years as children -- much like their parents -- became more enthralled with technology .,,000001000000100000000000100000000000000001000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000001000100100000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000,Submit,,

' We 're seeing what appears to be a new geological phenomenon &#44; ' she said . She is one of many experts who have combed the terrain for clues on the origin of these potentially dangerous holes &#44; which are about a foot in diameter and seem to survive for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand . Investigators have used ground-penetrating radar and specialized GPS devices to peek below the landscape &#44; but no one is entirely certain why the holes form along the surface of this landmark &#44; which attracts thousands of visitors each year . The National Park Service announced this week that Mount Baldy will remain closed indefinitely due to the discovery of two new holes and a number of depressions on the north side slope &#44; though the rest of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore will be open .

The app is part of an ambitious effort by environmentalists to use data and social media to use the power of public opinion in a country that lacks other routes to social change &#44; such as elections or an independent judiciary . China has many laws against pollution &#44; Ma said &#44; but ' enforcement is weak ' because the cost of committing violations is too low .,,000000000000000000000100000000000001000000010000000000000000000000000000001000000001100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000010000000010000,Submit,,

The debut was quieter than intended because it was overshadowed by the Great War that had just erupted in Europe &#44; where 16 million men under arms were rushing into the fight &#44; and thousands of soldiers had already died in early battles in Belgium and France . The canal had been first discussed in the 16th century . By cutting the time required to travel around the southern tip of South America &#44; trips between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans could be faster . And in the world of commerce and international trade &#44; faster means cheaper and better . The French &#44; flush with their success from digging and opening the Suez Canal in 1869 &#44; started work on the canal in Panama in 1881 . This project &#44; though &#44; turned out to be much harder . The humidity &#44; heat and muddy soil made digging difficult . Tropical diseases and accidents led to the deaths of more than 20&#44;000 men .

It should be no surprise then that young children play ' police and Taliban &#44; ' chasing each other around with toy guns and weaponry designed to mimic the real thing . And like the real war &#44; there have been casualties . At least 184 people &#44; nearly all children &#44; suffered eye injuries over the recent Eid al-Fitr holiday from toy weapons that fire BB pellets and rubber shot &#44; health officials said . In response &#44; authorities have banned toy guns . ' The Afghan Interior Ministry orders all police forces to confiscate toy guns &#44; which can lead to physical and psychological damage to people &#44; ' the order read .

Thinking of being in the sky brought the 17-year-old some respite . That 's when she first began fantasizing about piloting airplanes . ' Flying makes you feel big &#44; ' Berry said . ' You are on top of everything . Untouchable . You look down and all you see is the view &#44; the beauty . ' This summer &#44; Berry is one of eight African-American students in the Chicago area enrolled in a new &#44; rigorous program to learn how to fly and obtain a private pilot 's licenses . The initiative &#44; Tuskegee Next &#44; is a special effort to increase the number of African-Americans who can work as pilots &#44; said Stephen L.

Read an article and highlight the most difficult words,Our goal is to figure out what words are most difficult in a paragraph of text.,"reading, complex, difficult words",BAGHDAD - Compared to many Iraqis &#44; Mohammed Falah concedes that his life is n't so bad . He has a career &#44; a home . But nonetheless &#44; the 24-year-old civil engineer from Baghdad plans to fly to Turkey next week in order to join the surge of migrants and refugees making a bid for a better life in Europe . It is part of what Iraqi officials describe as a new ' brain drain ' as young graduates seize what they perceive as a rare opportunity to leave a country wracked by violence . More than 50&#44;000 Iraqis have left the country over the past three months &#44; according to the United Nations &#44; joining the hundreds of thousands making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean .

What she did n't realize was that he was buying virtual gems -- with real money -- to build his dragon park as part of the game . When she opened her credit card statement &#44; she saw a slew of charges from Apple &#44; totaling $ 600 in one day . ' I thought it was a mistake &#44; that someone had stolen my credit card &#44; ' said Nussbaum &#44; a mother of two children in Westerville &#44; Ohio .

But Dungan &#44; then 13 &#44; was shy and preferred nail polish and Disney princesses to running bases and wearing a batting helmet . Today &#44; Giambalvo and Dungan &#44; both 18 &#44; count down the days each week until they can see each other again on a baseball field for five Tuesdays in July and August . They hold hands as Giambalvo leads Dungan to first base after her hit goes airborne &#44; and they giggle together in the outfield while waiting to make a catch . Organizers say the girls ' five-year friendship -- which spills over from the baseball field to Taylor Swift concerts &#44; trips to the local swimming pool and other activities -- is an inspiring example of the meaningful bonds formed in programs like Buddy Baseball &#44; in which young people with special needs are exposed to sports with the help of kids without similar challenges .,,000000000000000000000010000000000000000010000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000001000000010000000000000000000000000000000100010000000000000000100000000100,Submit,,

On Thursday &#44; Alabama 's parole board pardoned the last of the long-dead Scottsboro Boys &#44; nine black teenagers falsely accused of rape in 1931 . Their case was monumental . It divided some residents here and united others &#44; led to two landmark Supreme Court decisions &#44; and precipitated the civil rights movement in the decades that followed . All the while &#44; though &#44; justice remained undone for some of the boys as they became men &#44; went into hiding &#44; and eventually died with the stigma of rape on their reputations .

Read an article and highlight the most difficult words,Our goal is to figure out what words are most difficult in a paragraph of text.,"reading, complex, difficult words",The act of walking may not seem like a feat of agility &#44; balance &#44; strength and brainpower . But lose a leg &#44; as Zac Vawter did after a motorcycle accident in 2009 &#44; and you will appreciate the myriad calculations that go into putting one foot in front of the other .

Colorado Senate President John Morse &#44; who shepherded the legislation to passage &#44; was defeated on a 51 percent-49 percent vote . Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo &#44; a fellow Democrat who voted in favor of the measures &#44; lost 56 percent to 44 percent . They were replaced by Republicans who opposed the new restrictions . The recall was the first in the 100 years since Colorado adopted the constitutional provision and grew out of sweeping measures passed last winter after mass shootings at a school in Newtown &#44; Connecticut &#44; and at a movie theater in Aurora &#44; outside Denver . The laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks &#44; to be paid for by the gun purchaser &#44; among other restrictions .

Researchers focused on three levels of the cave that Neanderthals used roughly 45&#44;000 years ago .

Oregon and Colorado on Nov. 4 will decide the fate of labeling laws for genetically modified organisms &#44; or GMOs &#44; the latest fronts in a battle over packaging . Measure 92 in Oregon and Proposition 105 in Colorado call for labeling food so that purchasers know whether they are buying products that contain materials that have been genetically engineered or modified . The states could become the first to pass such a referendum ; Washington state and California rejected similar measures after expensive campaigns in 2013 and 2012 &#44; respectively .

The sweeping &#44; unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug . The 9th Circuit said the case would have to be retried because an obviously gay juror was unjustifiably excluded from the jury . California state courts already prohibit the striking of jurors based on sexual orientation . Tuesday 's landmark ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states &#44; lawyers said .

He was 100 . ' Clearly Eiji was the person that laid the groundwork for what Toyota is today &#44; ' said David Cole &#44; former chairman of the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research . ' He was a real visionary and inspirational leader who understood what it would take to make Toyota a successful company . ' Toyoda &#44; a cousin of the Japanese automaker 's founder Kiichiro Toyoda &#44; died of heart failure at Toyota Memorial Hospital in Toyota city &#44; central Japan . The family used the Toyota name for the business because they believed it sounded better and because it was the winning entry in a 1936 logo competition . ' This is the Japanese equivalent of Henry Ford passing &#44; ' said Leslie Kendall &#44; curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles .,,000000000000000000000000010000000000010000000001000000101000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001010000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000001000000000,Submit,,
