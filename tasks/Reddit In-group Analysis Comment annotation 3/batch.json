Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D in a single or continued dose increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term and may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, low birthweight and preterm birth. However, when vitamin D and calcium are combined, the risk of preterm birth is increased. The clinical significance of the increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations is still unclear. In light of this, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Data on adverse effects were lacking in all studies. The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation should be given as a part of routine antenatal care to all women to improve maternal and infant outcomes remains unclear. While there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and increase length and head circumference at birth, further rigorous randomised trials are required to confirm these effects.

There's a very recent Cochrane review on the subject though: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008873.pub3/abstract  &gt; New studies have provided more evidence on the effects of supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone or with calcium on pregnancy outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D in a single or continued dose increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term and may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, low birthweight and preterm birth. However, when vitamin D and calcium are combined, the risk of preterm birth is increased. The clinical significance of the increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations is still unclear. In light of this, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Data on adverse effects were lacking in all studies. The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation should be given as a part of routine antenatal care to all women to improve maternal and infant outcomes remains unclear. While there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and increase length and head circumference at birth, further rigorous randomised trials are required to confirm these effects.  My wife will for sure eat EPA-DHA-capsules (omega 3) and a multivitamin product that's meant for pregnant women especially, when someday she's pregnant. ",

Im sure if you ask around youll hear similar stories. I know Ive read such stories here on reddit and elsewhere about gays and transgender too.

My doctor told me that above a certain level, its hard to predict when your kidneys will actually be in danger (If i remember correctly) and my kidney numbers were past that level. As for the liver, she said the numbers were high but she wasnt worried about it cause your liver is pretty fuckin resilient and they werent THAT high. Boners getting softer was just cause SARMs are testosterone supressive. They fight against your testosterone to bind to your androgen receptors and as a result, your body will just produce less and less testosterone. Sounds bad but its very dose and time dependent. 5mg for 8 weeks wont shut down most people's testosterone production. 10mg for 12 weeks probably will. People argue whether you need a PCT and the only way to know for sure is to get your test levels tested after your cycle. Personally, I barely noticed any other side effect that you see from suppressed/low testosterone (lethargy, dry joints, decreased libido) so I didnt PCT and honestly I think most people won't need to.",

My wife just surprised me with a used roland drumset that easily exceeds $1200 brand new for this particular model (wayyy too much money). She got it for $600 off craigslist and the lady she got it from took pretty good care of it. Needless to say, I am extremely happy with the gift and have been playing it non-stop since I got it and really enjoy the ability to lower the volume which I wasn't able to do on a real drumset.  She may not enjoy the gift as much as a BRAND NEW camera. But if she's a decent person she'll be grateful for it. Especially if she doesn't even know you have it.",

The trip would be a 25 minute car ride, and my wife just doesnt understand why I want to turn it into an hour each way. What I try to explain is the relaxation element. I get a little walk in, and get to sit and listen to music and read on the train. It takes longer, sure, but also gives me some chill alone time where I dont have to keep an eye on the traffic around me. ",

I have chosen to stay with my wife as I would rather live without sexual completeness than without my best friend, lifetime companion and love of my life. I could never love anyone as much as I love her and the love, strength and companionship she gives me are simply more important to me than the sexual satisfaction I crave.

The other main hormonal factors which affect your libido are DHT, oestrogen and prolactin levels. \\(Growth Hormone also plays a role\\).   You need to get numerical values for these 3. Medichecks are very good for getting tests you can do at home \\([https://www.medichecks.com/hormones?tap\\_a=15798\\-5ae160&amp;tap\\_s=122831\\-d1dba4](https://www.medichecks.com/hormones?tap_a=15798-5ae160&amp;tap_s=122831-d1dba4)\\).  If your other hormones are in check and you have normal/low SHBG it is your testosterone level which is the limiting factor in your libido. I would recommend trying a HCG/Clomid kickstart and seeing what happens over the next 4\\-6 months.   If your test level falls back to low levels later, then my recommended option is to try my HCG \\+ low dose Clomid long term protocol \\(check my forum post\\). If you have primary hypogonadism then you will likely have to go onto weekly testosterone injections if you value your libido, muscle mass and energy levels. ",

Basically its the same thing as bulking, except for my sport in college (shot put/discus) it wasn't really necessary to avoid the added fat that came with it so I could also retain all of the added strength. Generally what most people do during bulking is eat a lot more calories (healthy ones) than usual which aids in the development of muscles. They'll typically gain 20 pounds (just an example) of muscle and fat, then lose 5-10 pounds because its easier than just trying to gain pure muscle.   As long as your testosterone is well into male ranges and you're taking in enough protein, it probably shouldn't be an issue to put on weight and muscle. I also recommend gold standard whey protein, since a lot of different companies like to put filler that no one knows whats in it.

This doesn't make sense. They stop paying for her insurance just because she's pregnant?   School employees are often paid for 180 days or whatever but the pay is spread out over 12 months. I don't see what being pregnant has to do with this.   No paid maternity leave sucks, but it is what it is. If she isn't working, she won't get paid.

Neither of us have any idea how to run a business like that, and we also will probably have to rebuild the buildings by that time as well (they have built during the bubble years, and doesnt look that nice inside). Its currently about 20 apartments, but theres also some undeveloped land and a big parking area... so we are hopping to be able to expand the buildings size (and get more tenants). Anyone know where I/we can read up on it more?",

Any leftover money goes to IRAs or savings.  Honestly, it's not that bad. Sure, I'm not plowing $2-3k/month into my taxable accounts, but we should still be in good shape by our late 40s/early 50s.  Because my wife doesn't work, we're in a super low tax bracket. Add in the child tax credit, and the fact we have $0 in childcare expenses - things aren't so bad at all. So far we've spent $3.5k on the hospital bill, $1k in supplies (stroller, crib, clothes, bottles etc.). Weekly we spend about $50-100/week on diapers, milk, misc odds and ends. Adding her to my insurance costs $200 month. That's basically it for now. ",

If you decide you want to do this, start off with 100mg spiro for a few days, to make sure you tolerate it, then gradually increase estrogen from 2mg, to 4mg after about 3 weeks, to 6mg after about 6 weeks.  A blood test to check your testosterone level would tell you if you need more spiro, if you're worried about those could go up to 200 mg day.  These medications are pretty safe, but don't just stop and start them.  It should be fine to start taking them on a work day.",

I'm getting ready to start another new run od DD and DA once I pick DA up from my brother.   My old character had a level 98 (ending level) Mage Pawn from release day that was ranked 7-18 until I restarted after I beat the game. My internet then went down and I never got back into it.  I was hoping some people here could FR me at AcidRelic (I'm on the 360). My biggest problem is most people don't have good inclinations and that really matters alot. I can spend a good 2-3 hours finding the right Pawns and then after 5-10 levels have to spend another 2-3 hours finding stronger but useful pawns.  ..........Edit.. My wife just notified me I'm going to get it new for the PS3 so she can play Minecraft on the 360 when she want's and not wait on me LOL........    My PS3 is Acid_Relic.    Thanks for reading and I hope to work with your Pawns soon.",

He should be able to get govcare for the kids if he is collecting government benefits. Did the courts order him to pick up insurance? My ex wife hasn't paid childsupport except for $100 in the last 4yrs, a couple $20 payments. She is supposed to pay for insurance, yet she doesn't so I pay. After many court dates and nothing being done (she would pay $20 in rears to \"make the court happy\"). Otherwise they do nothing to hold her accountable, I just chock it up to women privilege. If he had insurance on them they would have their own cards. If you insist on snitching then document but personally I feel like a child should know both parents and this may make it harder for him with lack of housing ect plus if he does get caught for fraud he would have to pay it back, possible jail time too.

Best part about it is that my wife doesnt need to work and I can support us while she stays at home taking care of the 9 month old baby. ",

It's normal for there to be some variation. If it is still sensitive when you are aroused and it's not painful, it's usually not something to worry about.  However, some women who go on the pill start to have more painful intercourse or sexual problems related to hormonal changes in their bodies. If penetration starts to hurt, or your clitoris isn't as sensitive anymore, etc., then talk to your doc. Sometimes the added hormones can decrease your testosterone, which can have negative sexual outcomes (although most of the studies I read are with combined hormonal methods) and there is some initial evidence to suggest that hormonal contraception might change the size of the clitoris, labia, and introitus (entrance to the vagina) at rest [citation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02597.x/full).  So by itself, changes in size or shape is not usually a problem and variation is normal. However, if you start to have other sexual symptoms that are bothersome, talk to your doc.",

Which then leads to my first comment.  Unless and until you can concretely identify how you got into the CC debt in the first and how you will avoid going back into it in the future, you should not use your 401k as an \"easy button\" to pay off your credit cards.  Also, you can only borrow 50% of your 401k value.",

I currently bottle everything, but want to eventually get into kegging, so the larger fridge can be converted to a keggerator down the road, and it would fit the fermonster.   &amp;#x200B;  For context I have the money for both options, and the wife has given me the green light for the regular sized fridge.

When she was going to school she was 100% focused on school and pretty much completely ignored me the entire time. I cosigned 2 large loans for her so she could go to school. She wanted to go to nursing school for a better job (she worked in a research lab before). I felt very alone the entire time she was in school. She was either at school or studying - never made time for me. We were annoyed with each other constantly. Fast forward she gets her degree starts working. Odds are you will have to work the night shift when starting. I hardly ever saw her anymore. She then started having an affair with a co-worker. I divorced her ass. Nurses have a very high rate of divorce. From what she told me tons of flirting goes on there especially in hospitals with people who work the night shift. Everyone was basically fucking each other.   I would never marry another nurse again.",

I hadn't swung in almost a year. Later on I moved into the fastest cage which was between 80-85 mph. It was wet so the balls were all over the place.    She was completely blown away at how fast it was, and then I explained that there was still another 10mph in the MLB and that the balls literally could start at your head and finish at your knees.    Anyway, I think she loves the game even more now that she's seen what it's like to hit that fast. ",

But I knew it annoyed her as she wanted all my attention.  So I made sure to balance both.  Now she didnt play games not her thing.  Part of a healthy relationship is not just spending time together but having your personal time too.   It honestly doesnt appear you are spending too much time gaming it may even be the wrong time.  Your GF may be going through a similar thing.  Alternatively, she may have some pre-attained notion that games are bad from some belief or philosophy she prescribes to the unhealthy relationship to games comment may elude to this.  ",

Before starting TRT, I checked my testosterone levels 3 times (11.2 nmol/L, 15.2 nmol/L, 11.9 nmol/L) for the last one my free testosterone came in at 225 pmol/L.  These levels are very low for my age, and my physician started me on Androgel (1%) 2.5g packets, once a day (25 mg testosterone). Noticed my testicles were slightly more tender, no real side effects (positive or negative) in terms of libido or energy. I got myself tested again 3 weeks after starting Androgel and my test results came in as 11.5 nmol/L total testosterone and 219 pmol/L free testosterone. These results kind of shocked me, given that they are slight decreases. Additionally, I noticed that I recently began shedding hair a bit (I didn't have signs of male pattern baldness prior to treatment).

Not fapping will lead to a higher testosterone level, and that shit is awesome for growing, getting muscles, body and facial hair, and [lots more of stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone#Pubertal) that kids your age start going through. Keeping your testosterone low by fapping is probably going to slow all of this stuff down. You don't want to fall behind too much on this in high school, as kids your age can be real jackasses to 'slower-growers' and it can affect your self-esteem. Furthermore, all of this 'manliness' is going to come in handy when you're a bit older and you get to have sex with girls. Don't worry about legal issues on reddit as well, no one can stop you being here and I applaud you for thinking about this at your age.

To put it in some perspective, with WADA, the strictest standards in the world (and also guilty of some false positives over the years), if your blood has a T:ET ratio of over 4:1 or your testosterone is above 20,000ng, then you get flagged for carbon isotope testing.

Some people, depending on expectations or the time in their life, take it slower or longer. There isn't a national standard, it's very much based on your family's influence and your own feeling towards each other.   I'm guessing, in some cases the first year of marriage is when they are just starting to live together, but in modern times that is not usually the case. MOST people I know who are married lived together first.   &amp;#x200B;  Some women are hung up on that, most just want to know their partner appreciates them.

All three occasionally pixelate the signal, at night, with clear skies. I expect much worse during bad weather. I tried various directions and positions and that's the best I can get. To do anything larger than the 2V will require attic mounting and running cables. I think you're right that I'd need to get different antennas for each band.  For now, I'll be returning the 2V and just sticking with cable.

The inside of the packaging, which was sealed, has a little paper dust, but nothing unexpected. There was one film protector slightly out of alignment on the volume rocker side, but nothing I would get in a twist over, as you discard those anyhow. The cable and charged were LG branded and matched the ones I got with mine (which was purchased directly from the Google store 18 months ago). The sim tool matched the one I got, too.  This really seems like the real deal.  The phone activated quickly and easily, and my wife has been using it continually without issue. I did check na few basic functions first, and everything checked out. Now running 6.0 with Nov1 security patch (via OTA updates).  My wife just upgraded to the Nexus 5 from Samsung Galaxy S2. I'm really excited for her, and that I could get her this for such a good deal. We're both going to wait on the new Nexus phones and use the Nexus 5s, instead.",

(which I never do, I never eat before my workout) but I was so hungry and it was in the morning so I stuffed my mouth full and drank a new sample preworkout called total war.  I have experience in preworkouts with DMHA which is a substance in total war and once I chugged the shake it was so disgusting, sour gummybear flavor. I went over to the gym to have my volume bench day and had to wait a hour for the bench because 2 people were benching. They only did fuckin 1 reps every time with 1 plate in each side. And they kept doing 1 rep for about 30 sets or something.  I started to feel sick and tried to keep going but eventually just sat in a couch waiting for my girlfriend to finish her workout. ",

After the previews, the movie Epic started playing instead. I really didn't mind since I knew they would fix it eventually, but other people were getting pissed. A different person was running out to complain every 30seconds. Obviously the theater knew, but they can't fix it immediately and decided to just let Epic keep playing while they found IM2. We watched Epic for 15mins and people were acting like their car was just stolen. After IM2 finished, everyone got free tickets to their next movie, which end I used to take my girlfriend to Epic.

If you don't want to spend the time looking through pages of crap to get the good offers on Craigslist, get a good agent and give them the parameters of what you want, time frame and flexibility to opt-out and they should be able to find exactly what you want. (The agent might cost 1 or 1.5 the monthly rent).

The instrumentation at our lab has a reference range for males 18-50 yrs of 249-836. That's 90% of males measured with our test falls within that range. So really...you're pretty normal. Check with the reference ranges on your lab results because they're specific for the lab.      Also...testosterone is a difficult hormone to measure.

Noob gains is not some magical force, it's just a colloquial term for the very quick progress beginners experience when they start lifting weights.   From 16-20 you're going to have tons of hormones and a high metabolism, so don't worry. Your testosterone production hasn't even kicked into full drive yet, but it's started.  Buying heavier dumbells is a good start. Best thing you can do is buy a pullup bar - then you can get an amazing workout for your arms/back in, and also cling a dumbell between your legs later to add weight (or stick it in a backpack if that's better positioning).   Bodyweight exercises are great as well. Pushups, pullups, bodyweight squats can all help you an immense amount especially at the beginning. Core strenght and being able to manipulate your body weight will make lifting heavier weights later much easier. ",

On it, I suspected it didn't affect my libido - it was high or normal. Off it, my libido has not risen - it's just the same. I've never had a problem with erections.  My wife says she can see my hair thinning more rapidly in the last few months, but I am not sure myself.  Perhaps I should go back on it, but that shit is incredibly expensive.  Propecia/Proscar/Finasteride affects people in different ways, and I would say I was lucky, but then I was also in a dead bedroom. ",

My wife just got her third yesterday.  But beware the merger, could kill the off-peak Europe award. Hopefully not, but likely.   For Europe hotels, I'd recommend the 85K Club Carlson cards. If you maximize their last award night free benefit, you have enough for (at least) 4 free nights at very nice Radisson Blu properties. If you're going to Paris, Milan, or Zurich, the Hyatt card will get you two nights at the truly 5* Park Hyatts in those cities. Fairmont card might also work depending in location.  Delta miles blow. Not useless, just worth the least, by a long shot. Availability is awful, and no one-ways.",

I'll run a +250 on my two training days (enjoy a little taste of Europe) and -500 on rest days which will actually be more like -900 owing to standing/teaching all day and EC. I have very little appetite when I teach seminars anyway. I usually skip lunch and all I want after I'm done is a cigar and scotch. I usually need to force myself to eat to hit my kcals &amp; macros. Besides, any drop in libido while traveling without my wife will help keep me out of trouble.  That will put me net -3,600 per week and should be pretty much on target with my goal of loosing 4 lbs of fat by the time I return. ",

I'm not saying Xbox One controllers won't work on any engine, I'm just saying that one of largest indie publishers was willing to pay over £100 for controllers for 1 exhibition (that they didn't care about) when they wouldn't even pay £60 to rent a TV and instead got my girlfriend to show their game on a laptop rather than send a person over.  To me that heavily suggests they are confident that Xbox One controllers wouldn't work at least with that particular game, considering I offered to provide them for free. DS4s and Xbox 360 controllers verifiably work with it though.",

I sponsored her about 6 months before our wedding, I rememeber sending like a 140 page document with over 50 pictures, Skype message history, letters from our friends about how we met etc to immigration. A week after our wedding we got her landed immigrant status and she moved to Canada the following January.

The two families are too different, we were afraid that they wouldnt get along.  Also, the big wedding would have to be done in two countries, costing us double the exorbitant amount of money. The husband side of the family would totally pay for everything, they are very rich, but they are the kind of people that would put pressure on you through money. We hard-pass on their money.  My family doesnt have money but they are the type that work too hard to keep up the appearance, I would hate for my mother to rack up debt just to keep up with husbands family money.  So we went to Vegas, we watched a lot of cirque du solei, eat at a lot of celebrity chef restaurants, rented a ferrari for 4 hours... great experience, no regret, and we still saved a tons of money which is then used for downpaying our first house.  10/10 will advice others to elope.",

Best of all, some challenges like the drift races teach you the skills you need to improve at the game without the pressure of dealing with other racers/items. And there's still the World Tour mode if you want that more classic 4-track Cup experience from Mario Kart.  But I'm mad at Sega for teasing us Skies of Arcadia fans by putting Vyse in the game and then nothing coming of it.  They should definitely make a sequel to this or add a DLC track/characters from Valkyria Chronicles.",

For me, the solution was to get out and I am much, much happier now with a woman who matches my libido and desires affection and intimacy. I loved my ex wife dearly and it was hard to let that go but I knew if I had stayed that I would end up a shell of a man. I hope that doesn't happen to you.",

This would make you a 4,5/10. Your overall looks are better though, you have an awesome clothing style and wearing your hair without a bun makes you look a lot better in my opinion.  Improvement points: * tan your skin * lift heavy, also make sure you're low bodyfat to make your bone structure stand out more * practice proper oral posture * live healthily and keep your testosterone levels high, this will improve your facial growth and make you look more dimorphic  Best of luck mate",

So I bought us both Fitbits and she was putting in 10k steps a day and not losing weight.   I don't mind a little junk in the trunk because I like curves but it was odd how fast she put on weight, especially since she had an over active thyroid and a young metabolism. She just started piling on weight.   Come to think of it, my ex wife did the same thing before she cheated. She just kind of gave up working on herself and started porking out (60+ lbs) while I was taking care of her and paying all the bills.   ",

            "Input.text1": "flatlining is the low energy state of the withdrawal stage of nofap. Flatlines will cycle with superpowers between days 15-90 (this obviously varies on how addicted you are). During this cycle, which starts right after the initial feel good stage of the first 15 days, there are two main states that change when your testosterone levels change. The high energy state- the superpower state- is when your testosterone peaks and you feel amazing again. This state will expand the longer you abstain from pmo. The flatline- the low energy state- is when you feel anxious lethargic and impotent because of the lack of testosterone. This state will contract the longer you abstain from pmo. When the withdrawal process begins, your flatline state will last longer (8-10 days)than your superpower state (4-6 days). As you progress through the withdrawal stage, superpowers will last longer and flatlined with last shorter. By day 90, superpowers should last 10-15 days and flatlined should last 6-12 hours. By day 180, flatlines are almost none existent.",

This was her first time meeting my mom, my sister, and several of my close relatives and friends. So basically, it was kind of important.  After dinner, we said bye to everyone and went to a friend's house to party and crash for the night. The next day, I woke up with a terrible hangover and some shit in my underwear. WTF?  So she explains what happened. Turns out that during the night, I farted so loud it woke her up. Unfortunately, it wasnt just a fart. My girlfriend was sleeping next to me, woke up due to the smell and the noise, saw what happened (i was laying on my stomach) and then........  &amp;#x200B;  ........went back to sleep.

You'll still need to lower your T by about 80% though.  My suggestion would be to double estrogen and keep spiro at the current dose. If you absolutely want, then increase your spiro to a total of 150mg per day. Maybe 100mg in the morning plus 50mg in the evening.  Doubling your estrogen dose will increase your E and will also help to further lower your T.  I'd also suggest to get your next bloodtest in 1-2 months. The sooner you see how your levels develop, the sooner you can make more adjustments if necessary. ",

Im probably going to get burned at the stake here, but my most recent example is probably the worst...I sold my 2016 VW GTI (Autobahn edition, stick, Performance Package, white...perfect) with only 29k miles on it. I bought a 340i M-Sport with an auto instead.   The stick was actually the main reason...I started spending more time in city traffic, and I wasnt enjoying it as much. Also, despite many lessons, my wife just couldnt get comfortable with it. Which caused some logistical challenges because we could never swap cars--I could never take her car for service, I couldnt take her car if I need to haul something bigger during the day, etc. because then she wouldnt have a car.  Plus Ive just really wanted to get back in a BMW since I had one more than 10 years ago college. Just really like the way they feel (some of them anyway). Found a great deal on my one year-old 340i and stole it. Slightly less tossable than the GTI, but much quicker!",

My wife has grown from 170 to 205 lbs now. I'd like to see her back at the 250 she once was but I'm taking what I can. So: if you're not aiming for HUGE, maybe/probably the health scare isn't there, or at least not that much.   Remember: you don't need to grow someone by feeding them only fat fast food.  And the other thing is that _in general_ people gain weight as they get older. In general people let go and want to have fun and eat. If, in my case, my wife doesn't put in the grueling discipline it takes to lose weight and keep it off, I might as well enjoy the journey.  Oh -- and I think there's a whole evolutionary, biological background to liking big(ger) people. In that way I find being excited by weight (gain) on a totally different level than having sex with your dog (although I respect the level of perversion!) ",

Not sure yet with the exact percent because we just started the process to refinance and haven't signed anything yet. We are doing a va loan so that's why the interest will be lower. The house was appraised at 105k and we owe 101,300. My initial plan is to pay off all loans in the next two years and be debt free then start investing/ paying off the house probably? Not sure 100% what the best route would be though and that's why I'm here. My wife just gave me a speech too. She thinks I'm becoming obsessed with finances. Not too fond of her right now.

Packed on a fair bit of muscle with some solid lifting 3-4 times a week but also developed a little gut (lol) but that's the result of bulking. I was eating about 3700 calories a day.  Just be prepared for a giant shitstorm in your stomach and ass the first 2 weeks when your body adjusts for all that extra calories if you jump straight to a high calorie diet, which is what I did when I was just consuming about 2800-2900 calories to maintain my weight.  What I'd suggest is that if you don't want to pack on too much/look fat, bulk for 2 months then cut for 1 month and cycle through that until June.  EDIT: Since your 15 and going through puberty your testosterone levels are probably peaking so deadlifts, squats and bench press are your best friends to get big.",

Another time I was with a group of 12 people that we were trying to create a fraternity with (for my 19th I think). We had to do some stupid piece of shit puzzle until 7 AM on my birthday.

Slept when I got back, ate some Panda Express at night, and that's it. On my 20th, my roommates forgot it was my birthday until my girlfriend told one of them. Took a birthday shot.

And since running is catabolic, your body will utilize your glycogen for the first 5-10 mins and then muscle for energy because your body is telling itself that it must burn glycogen and muscle for you to run more efficiently. It takes about 30 mins for the body to start utilizing fat for energy.  So instead of running do sprints, preferably 6 sets of 30 seconds. Which will increase your testosterone and keep you anabolic; meaning it encourage muscle growth and no muscle breakdown. You should also include weight training specifically strength training, 6 to 8 reps is the sweet spot. So if fat loss is your goal then strength training and endurance training is your best bet.  Remember testosterone is also a fat burning hormone. So it doesn't make sense to run for long periods of time while you risk losing your muscle unless your goal is to become a marathon runner.

I am willing to pay triple what you gave for it at the store. This is what it looked like when we finished it in 2012. It's a little banged up and dirty by now from being moved and stored.

I cannot buy a house, (unless I save up the cash).  Paying off the debt would give me a better life 25 to 30 years in the future.  Also, the legal/i.t. job isn't something you can just jump back into.  My ex wife owns 50% of that business and essentially burned the bridges I would have had to stay in NY to keep.  The connections I had, I forfeited to her as part of our separation.  At this point to take back that revenue stream I'd have to move back to NY and force her out of the business space that we had created together.  It's not like I have an easy job.  I am out in 100+ degree heat most of the day and work all weekends, when I used to sit behind a desk, I'd fall asleep, so it's not just about being happy, but doing work that suits my physical limits.",

I suffer the anxiety of spilling something on it, but it holds a special place in my heart and I love putting it on when Sunday comes around. I also live in Chicago so if I'm stumbling home drunk on gamedays from the bar it makes it easy for the uber driver/my girlfriend to pick me out of a crowd. Dunno if this helps.

Im thinking if my wife will go up with me and my CFI for an easy sight-seeing flight. It would give me a chance to try a heavier gross weight and more aft CG along with maybe flying the VFR corridor.   Anyway, I hope your next one isnt cancelled and Im sure youll rock it!

My heroin use eventually started to fuck with my diet and lifting schedule, and I was getting out of shape  I used to love getting blasted and lifting for 3-4 hours, but opiate addiction just doesn't mix well with lifting.  It lowers your testosterone level, fucks with your digestive system, and it dehydrates you like mad.  But that's all secondary to the fact that proper, structured nutrition and exercise routines are not really compatible with addiction in the long-term.  I'm quite certain that using H for another 6-12 months would have resulted in me eventually stopping lifting altogether and saying fuck it about my diet.",

My guess is you've lead a pretty 'normal' life to date. I guess I didn't.  My mom divorced when I was 2. I grew up not knowing my dad. I guess lack of self esteem led me to seeking an ego boost through having sex.    Problem was, I've ruined every serious relationship with cheating.  Anytime I needed a 'boost' go out and have sex. Always had booty calls willing. I was broken. I've finally either matured or found the perfect woman for me.  Either way, I'm finally able to be faithful to my current gf of over 2 years.   YOU AREN'T MISSING ANYTHING.   I have plenty of crazy stories, but my life isn't better because of it.  Be happy you have the ability to be in a healthy relationship.  The 'party life' really isn't all you may think it is. ",

We would have gone to urgent care but it looked terrible and the ER was nearby. In addition to them treating me like a wife beater they told me I owed them $4000 for an ice pack and having a nurse look at it. (They didnt even wipe any of the dried blood off of her face).    They seemed to think I was going to just whip out a credit card and pay that.  I just laughed, told them to send me a bill, and walked out.  It arrived 4 months later for $85. ",

So I went on to do PCT of Nolva at 40/40/20/20 and i still felt really rough, So I blasted 6 shots of HCG at 2000IU EOD along with aromatase inhibtors everyday. This actually made me feel ok again, but after taking tramadol for a week (apparently this messes with your test) and then coming off, I feel like I'm right back where i started, I feel depressed, never in the moment, unable to eat much at all, cant sleep properly, no morning wood, and anxiety attacks multiple times per day.  I am waiting on my bloods to come back this week so will update with more information when they arrive, but has anyone else been through this? Am I going fully crazy? I just want to feel normal! ",

Signups for softball are over but im sure there are teams that would add a player.  Slow-Pitch softball, the Wichita Parks Dept has a single player signup list that she can use to find a team that needs girls.

Have her join the Y/Genesis and show up consistently and she'll end up with some friends from there if she isnt too introverted.

Right now your frame, what the muscle is going to attach to, is growing. If you don't eat well now, you may never develop the frame correctly to put the muscle onto.  Here's what I would do if I were you (me again). 10-15 pushups, 3-4 pullups, 20 situps and/or5-10 crunches and 10 squats (no weights on any of these) every other day at most. You really don't need to do muscle destroying exercises, you're already in an anabolic state as a 14 year old dude. This will be adequate for your age and help promote testosterone without over exerting your body and dropping your testosterone.  What you can do wrong is: not eat enough food and fail to develop.  Even as a full adult, gaining muscle is 80-90% of the workout. For you I'd say 95-98% of the work out. Don't do weights now, just wait.",

I didn't even realize I was twice as fat. I thought I was still under my initial 250. Now I'm eating between 1700-2000 and plan on eating this much for the rest of my life.

Now I say again, the course was mandatory. I got this teacher who used the class to extend her liberal, feminist agenda and assigned reading that fit her ideals, totally off syllabus, and not even close to what the class was about. When I inquired, I was told that because I was a man, I wouldn't get it. She constantly gave irrelevant assignments, and her grading was arbitrary at best.   &amp;#x200B;  She gave me a D at mid terms and I ended up going to the dean.

You know this because someone found the elements that came together that even made the car possible before it was even drivable. The whole idea of the car was designed by a designer.. So many complex elements, years of tests, trials, and tribulations led to the design of the internal combustible engine known as the car. This car designer was a man, if that same man dropped the car in the year 1422 those people would think a God design this marvelous complex machine, but we in the 21st century know better. We know there was a designer because nothing just appears especially nothing that complex... Not even a planet. When those people of 1422 start taking the car apart they find that it was designed by someone, somewhere because all these peices won't make since to them naturally. There has to be a super natural, all powerful, eternal being to even create a planet with these elements, spawn creatures (humans) that can one day discover the possibilities of the world around them.

We both have high salaries (this year we're expecting to cross into the 33% bracket), but I'm the only one with FIRE plans. My wife plans to retire when she's 60-65.  So let's say 10 years from now I have my nest egg built up. The next step would be to quit my job, rollover my 401(k) into a traditional IRA and start a Roth conversion ladder. If I were single, I'd just convert enough to not cross the 25% bracket. But I'm married and my wife will likely still be earning a good salary. What would I do, then? I guess the answer would be to file separately, but that would kind of screw her because the brackets for married people filing separately are horribly disadvantageous.

This is all done by our butcher, but we were talking about investing in a grinder to do the sausage ourselves.  Whenever I make a moose steaks or roast, I marinade it for a day and season heavily.

We both have high salaries (this year we're expecting to cross into the 33% bracket), but I'm the only one with FIRE plans. My wife plans to retire when she's 60-65.  So let's say 10 years from now I have my nest egg built up. The next step would be to quit my job, rollover my 401(k) into a traditional IRA and start a Roth conversion ladder. If I were single, I'd just convert enough to not cross the 25% bracket. But I'm married and my wife will likely still be earning a good salary. What would I do, then? I guess the answer would be to file separately, but that would kind of screw her because the brackets for married people filing separately are horribly disadvantageous.

Then I finally got my act together, retook some classes to increase the grade, transferred to UofO, got a BS in Economics, graduated with a 3.0 overall, after 5 years total in college, including summer school almost every year, so really it was like 6 years of college.      I am now a worker's compensation adjustor, and have been for abot 7.5 years. I earn $75,000 base salary, get 5 weeks of PTO per year, and target bonus is about 8-10% annually.      I still regret not focusing more in school and getting a job that would allow me to move up more, earn more so that my wife doesn't have to work.

If you only got fat and little muscle then you should cut back on calories and add some cardio to your workout routines. But you say you're weight is 115 pounds, that is to little for your age. Me myself is 15 and i'm at 154 pounds with mostly muscles and little fat, around 10-12%.   My other tip is now when you're still a teen your testosterone is high so you should eat a ton of calories to gain muscle and you can lose the fat you gain when you're starting to become older. (age 21-22). 15 pounds is not much at all when you're 18 and your weight is 15. I gained 8 pounds in a week from only lean muscle a while back. Just continue what you're doing and measure yourself in the mirror. But that's just my opinion.  You can do whatever the f*ck you want to do!",

He asked her if she wanted to make some extra money babysitting his daughter. My girlfriend took his number but never called him. She thought something was \"off\" about him, in part because he was trying to look as if he was a student (by wearing a backpack and dressing like a college student), but was clearly too old.   It turns out he was a convicted kidnapper and rapist. Police later found condoms and a sock filled with rocks in his car.

The accident was not that bad for a lawyer. It was a 2017 Nissan Versa, something about radiator mount was broke. I never went to the DR. Once you tell lawyers you did not need a doctor, they pretty much lose interest. I got 4700.00 plus 13,000 to pay off my car loan. Progressive was really cool about everything.

I can have sympathy for what they experience, but because its not a life I have to live and experience every day, I personally dont feel like I have the right to tell a woman I fully understand what they experience.   I say this as a man in his early 20s. Growing up I was ignorant to a lot of things faced by others, I didnt understand things like victim blaming until I was 20/21 because of open discussions. I didnt really understand how prevailing sexual harassment was until I had conversations with female friends about their experiences.   Im saying that as humans were not infallible, and the answer to these problems isnt to ostracise, but rather to educate. Underexpose and unawareness I think is more responsible than malice intent.

So injecting 200mg a week, which isn't uncommon to see a 6.5x response would put your total test at 1300 which is higher than they should be for a cruise based on all of the information I have read.

Since starting, I've been feeling much more energized and would not rather be in bed than at my desk. I don't wake up starving anymore. I'm m/31/6'2 and started at 342 lbs. After a week of tracking every single thing I put in my body and staying under 26 carbs/day I'm at 335 lbs. I don't really see a difference, but my wife says my shirts are fitting better. I'm really excited to continue to see progress.   &amp;#x200B;  Personal victory: 7 days of keto, -7 lbs.",

That said, I have very strong signal maybe 98% of the time when I'm out and about since I tend to be near cities all the time.  There are times when I'm driving way out in the country and there is absolutely no signal whatsoever.  Those are times I'm glad for the Verizon phone just in case my car breaks down or something.  My wife doesn't even have that, so I've considered getting her a pre-paid phone that works on the Verizon network just for emergency situations.  Overall I'm extremely happy with T-mobile but there are some distinct drawbacks, particularly when it comes to coverage area.",

You risk damaging your body for nothing.  at 250/week you will feel great, that is steroid cycle lite.  Honestly if you're going to play around with self-medicating go 300-500mg/week Test E for 12 weeks.  Do bloodwork at the 5 week mark to check that your e2 is not too high and adjust.  PCT off as normal or consider TRT (which is for life)  These are options.  We're kind of in the wrong sub here now, but you're walking the line between TRT and Steroids....  there is a massive difference between 125mg and 250/week.  IMHO, go big or go home.

I've been loving DP4 on my Hwatch - I don't feel like people have been shouting about it enough, I truly think the OS is ridiculously better than AW 1 on a design and functionality level.  This example on Telegram being used is interesting - I don't use this app but the fact it's showing pictures/stickers and full chat functionality is very nice. Is this a Telegram app? I have been using Allo since its release (I know, I know - I convinced my girlfriend to use it) and I'm sad there's no hint of an Allo app for AW 2.0 as a heavy amount of Allo's use is media, stickers etc... It's a shame I can't preview that stuff as nicely as this little Telegram preview here.",

The handle was a bit too flat for my taste, but you're right - the lockup was excellent. I've since purchased and carried my current (drop-point?) Griptillian.  I also bought a Spyderco Wave Delica 4 to try out the Wave feature and for a lighter/smaller Spyderco knife. As you can see from my Grip, the pocket clip on my knives takes a lot of abuse. Well, the three screws that held the clip on the Delica eventually fell out and got lost when I brushed against something, and that was the end of that knife. I gave it (clipless) to my girlfriend to carry in her purse.",

They told me it was a family dinner, yet my brother brought his girlfriend to his bday dinner just six months prior. I called out my parents and said if she isnt allowed then Im not going to dinner. I basically was telling them that if they didnt accept me then I wasnt going to come around. So find people that will love you for who you are. There are many people out there that will.

America has redesigned its economy around each worker having 7 to 12 employers during their lifetime instead of 1 or 2. In such a system, you hire the guy who is job-hopping from a lower or same-tier job with relevant experience. You won't invest in training a person because he'll be leaving in 2 to 4 years anyway. Or, if you do train him, he's signed an employment contract to stay with the company for X years or pay a penalty / payback.  My wife just got a $5,000 signing bonus, with the stipulation she'll stick around for 5 years, or pay it back. While a signing bonus helps lure recruits, it also drives them away as they get a signing bonus someplace else after meeting the contractual obligations for which they were hired. Employers fuck themselves.  Look to a company like Costco, which pays most employees a good wage, and benefits, with the intention of keeping them long-term.",

I previously rented in the same city as I own, and the constant fear of rent increases (they went up 200/month the first year, another 100/month the second year) pushed me to just buy.

Lifting has great benefits, and I wouldn't deter anybody from starting, but I want to make sure people know there are other options.  For me, it was just running and jiu jitsu.

Relevant \"supplements\" are some cardarine I've been testing from a chain store. Suspicions I had read about this store were that their LGD, osta, cardarine, etc. was repackaged prohormones they couldn't sell after the ban. This would explain the doubling of my test, but I would have thought it would suppress me and not triple my lh/fsh.  Anecdotally, my testicles feel larger than precycle and I've thought that since PCT before getting these results. I still have mild chest acne. Gonna take an asin to get my e2 lower, glad I still have that on hand. Want to retest but I'm not 100% about what route to take with the cardarine, as far as how much time to wait after final dose.",

Diabetes is a large cause of ED that most people don't know about, so if you're downing lots of sugar and carbs, might consider switching to some veggies and lean meats to see how you do (plus it's healthier).  As for how long you last, 10 minutes of penetration is normal. The average is 3-13 minutes apparently. The stereotype of the \"all night marathon\" is pretty much for the outliers.",

Almost leads me to believe the numbers you have are wrong or are in wrong measurement because when I look at averages:  * 9:00 am\t140[58]\t700[58]\tnmol/L * * 5[59]\t25[59]\tμg/dL * Midnight\t80[58]\t350[58]\tnmol/L * * 2.9[59]\t13[59]\tμg/dL  So if I convert your numbers your AM is .81 μg/dL and bedtime is 0.021 μg/dL  When I convert your testosterone to look at averages yours shows to be 19000 ng/dl (Avg. Adult Male 270-1,070)  Based on cortisol I would say cut back on exercise for a bit and stick to just weight training maybe for now.   Also Estradiol levels are also extremely low as average is 15-45.  [Interesting Read](http://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/health/the-problem-of-low-estrogen-for-men-20131022)",

Dating can be emotionally exhausting.  You get your hopes up only to be disappointed when it doesn't work out.   I married my wife in 2015, just before I turned 37.  It took a lot of patience between 2000 and 2015.  I'm glad I didn't give up.  I certainly felt discouraged along the way.    And sometimes discouragement can continue even after marriage.  Today I learned my wife will miscarry our child after 8 weeks of pregnancy :(   I hope you can be patient.  Waiting is hard.  It's part of enduring to the end.  I pray your patience will be rewarded.  ",

I did the first injection at 1ml/cc to see how I would react.  After the first injections I did 3ml's every two weeks apart.  My right testicle is dead and the left one needs another shot or two.

Usually, when these studies discuss endurance-trained athletes they're discussing the elite athletes at the long end of the tail, not the average or even aggressive fitness-minded person.  I'm struggling to find the last time this topic came up, but when I read the details of the previous study they were only looking at people running the equivalent of a marathon every 4 days. Clearly that's not very relevant to anyone running a few miles every morning before work.  The last study you cited had people training an average of 1.8 hours per day, 5 days per week, at 80% of VO2max as their example of high-intensity exercise. Even then, their testosterone and other biomarkers returned to baseline after a recovery period.  Don't let this discourage anyone from doing cardio. Even if your testosterone drops slightly, you're still going to come out far ahead relative to being sedentary.",

We couldn't have our phones in class, so we'd only be able to use them after we got back from the schoolhouse at about 1645.  In sub school, it was a little more relaxed, though I still couldn't have my phone in the schoolhouse. Class ran from 0730 to 15-1530, but we didn't march as a group, so much more relaxed atmosphere. PT was 3 days a week instead of 5, and we had \"voluntary\" study time after class in the schoolhouse (1730-2030). I rarely went, but it was there and did help the guys who needed it.

I'm not noticing any of the common failures of the water pump, nothing is dripping from the front end that I've noticed, temp is good, etc. It does seem like it's coming from deeper in the engine than the alternator (and we've not noticed any wonky electrical issues). This summer we had some work done to the power steering, I want to say the pump may have been replaced, but maybe not. I know the pressure lines were done though. I'm gonna have to call the shop and see if they changed the pump or not. My wife just messaged me back saying that she has felt the steering get tougher a couple times but didn't think anything of it. We're not noticing any signs there like it whining when we're turning.

Mom worked in retail part time. Both are now retired boomers traveling the country in a RV. I went to college with two degrees. Programming and Mechanical Engineering. I work 50 hours a week and live paycheck to paycheck with very little in my 401k to retire on. I don't live beyond my means. I provide for my wife and two kids. Due to the high cost of daycare, we decided that one of us should stay home to be with the kids.  That luxury seems to be fading as the cost of living keeps rising. Most likely my wife will have to go back to work and when the Grandparents get home they will have to watch the kids. My point. There are a lot of great trade jobs out there making great money. Looking back I should've gotten a job with my dad and look forward to collecting a pension in several years.",

I turned 37 this year and my wife just turned 34. We have been saving up for IVF for a couple of years since almost no insurances will cover it. I've even taken jobs just because of the insurance had covered it, but when I got hired in, they changed the coverage. We almost have the money saved up, but have been trying acupuncture in the meantime. Some girls from the support group my wife is in have become pregnant after seeing this acupuncture lady, and they have the same issue as my wife, so I am hopeful. We're hoping 2015 is the year it happens, as these Christmases keep getting more difficult for her.  I bet you are really excited for April to get here.",

There is such a thing as testosterone deficiency, even in women, and [evidence suggests this can cause lethargy, anxiety, depression, among other things](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11304877). As long as you're below 85 ng/dL (3 nmol/L) you're fine and won't see masculinization (aside from perhaps still having a sex drive).  For me, estrogen alone (2 mg per day) was enough to push it into the female range (as seen above). So you may be able to lower your Spiro dose (or even remove it) without loss of feminization, if you so wish.  It may be a bit difficult for your doctor to judge however since [Spiro doesn't directly impact testosterone levels](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/97dda8/the_more_research_i_do_the_less_i_believe_spiro/e47tgw1/), unlike e.g. Cypro.",

Your body's just gonna keep producing testosterone as usual.  Edit: I misread your post, I thought your T levels weren't good either, I think I skipped a line or something, sorry.  From what I read [here](http://www.newhealthguide.org/Normal-Estrogen-Levels.html) normal estrogen levels are about 150pg/ml, so yours is extremely low. If your T is very low as well, that's definitely not good. You can't wait for the levels to just rise on their own, your doctor has to do something. It's not healthy to have too low levels of hormones in your body, it needs to have decent levels for it to work properly. It's dangerous for your health, get an appointment with her.",

If you want to really pick up skills, I would recommend them. They aren't the cheapest, but worth every peso.  Another place to consider for great value for money diving is Tulamben in Bali. It's really isolated and nothing else to do but dive, but really affordable. Some resorts (e.g. Matahari Resort &amp; Spa) have packages where you can do unlimited dives for a fixed price. It's cheaper to spend a month diving in Tulamben 3-4 times a day than to live in Beijing ;-). Good stuff to see around there is the USAT Liberty wreck, Drop Off wall dive and nearby Seraya for some awesome muck diving.   If you speak/read Chinese, there is some diving around Beijing, in local lakes and rivers. The local diving community does organise events. One of them can be found here: http://www.doyouhike.net/forum/deepblue/2313029,0,0,0.html  I think you can even dive the aquariums if you can locate the right organisers. They won't be deep dives (3-5m) but they will be salt water with fish.     ",

I agreed. Recently (16 years later), gay porn and fantasy just wasnt doing it anymore. I finally talked to her, and miraculously she agreed to allowing me to hunt for a FWB.   Im not saying this will work in every situation, but if she knows youre bi, maybe you should talk to her. Youd be the best judge of how that conversation might go.   Ive since hooked up with a couple guys, and its been great fun! Knowing she knows and grants permission allows me to not feel like a cheater, and whether or not its coincidence, I had some of the hottest sex with my wife just the other night that I can remember.  It feels like weve been fed the Victorian concept of heterosexual monogamy until we cant accept that its possible for there to be other viable options. NGL, it takes work and a lot of honest, open conversation, but for me its been completely worth it. Best of luck!",

That leaves several hundred dollars left to budget for things like groceries, pets, gifts/birthdays etc...I then ask her and we have a discussion.  \"We have 800 left, how much do we need in groceries till we get paid again etc...\".  I just enter it in on the computer when I'm sitting at the table with her, and about 5-10 minutes later we are done.    I keep track of all our spending and manage the budget, and she decides where the money goes.  She's not great at putting things in on the mobile app, but she does what she can and she does at least look at the values.    YNAB is perfect for your situation. ",

The fastest female server achieved a speed of 131 mph.  With that speed, she literally doesn't even place on the top 30 list for men. Position #31 for men had a speed of 143 mph. Position #1 is *163 mph*.  Men have significant advantages when it comes to speed, which determines how fast the ball is moving and how far in the court it can go.  When you consider that humans have limited reaction times as well, being able to hit the ball faster and force a reaction is incredibly valuable.  Men undoubtedly have an advantage over women in tennis and I see no reason that wouldn't translate in some form to Table Tennis.  &gt; As for the brain thing I don't know about that. Women could easily play aggressive.  And men could theoretically play less aggressive, but people don't choose how aggressive they're feeling, that's determined by your brain and by your testosterone levels. It's something you can't reliably control for and thus is reasonable grounds for a divide between men and women.",

DNA Squonk and a single battery tube mod for when you dont feel like squonking. If you wanna drip 24/7 instead of use an RTA just nix the Serpent. EHpro Mod 101 is also insanely durable. If you decide to nix the squonk idea just go with some like like a Lost Vape Paranormal with whatever RDA strikes your fancy. Still recommend the Maze v3 but also the Pulse 22 as well.

My work gives me 14% 401 without needing to contribute so I'm not immediately concerned with that and we put 4% into HSA. Hoping to start tightening things down a bit more get the amount we put in our checking as low as I can. My idea is to start using the 2nd account for additional categories.

And the kit went up in price but you could pick up any urine bag off a Google search. Just look up urine bag or catheter bag. You can pick those up for less than 10 bucks.

If we are going to live near one of our offices, we'd rather live in Palo Alto than the city.   I have gotten really into audiobooks lately and I wouldn't be driving, so the time on the train doesn't sound completely awful, but then again I've never done anything like this before (my current commute is 15 mins on a busy day).

The hotels are now at least a grand for a room.    What's worse was that  I remembered my dad negotiating with the manager to get a lower price.

The goal is to have a good sized account for my son he can either use for college or his first house down payment when he comes age.  Custodial account looks like it has a lot of limitations and risks for very little advantage and 529 is the same.  Should I put a small amount in a 529 and just earmark another taxable brokerage account for him?  How would gifts from his grandfather work as well?  I just had my first child and my father and I want to put together some money for my son.  A couple years on this forum and others like it and I feel pretty well versed in accounts for myself (currently maxing government 457b and Roth IRA, contributing to pension, and saving additional in a mix of high interest savings and taxable brokerage.)  I make about 100k in HCOL area, could grow that to maybe 130-150k in the next few years.  Married, but my wife will stay at home or work very little to supplement spending.  Might have another kid in a year or 2 depending how this goes.",

I thought it might be because she was listed as an AU on 3 of my Chase cards.  I had removed her as an AU on all of these cards, but I thought maybe Chase was still counting those for 5/24 purposes.  She did a recon and told the rep that she was removed as an AU from all three accounts and the rep said that she would resubmit the application, but it had to be reviewed further.  My wife just got the denial letter based on two many recent credit card applications.  I have a feeling that her Banana Republic VISA card is putting her at 5/24.  Does anyone know if a store card like that counts towards 5/24?  She only used it once at Christmas time at Banana Republic, but I assume (but don't know)  that it's a regular VISA card and as such counts towards 5/24.  Anyone have insight on this?  Thanks.",

Yeah, we dont sell the Remaster title used/preowned so it was a mistake.  Ok... well are you going to honor your mistake?    We did by taking 10.00 off...  No, the price was 9.99....

Anyway, it was a lot better when we went on 4/20. It was pretty empty, but thats pretty common for trance shows, especially during Coachella weekend. No assholes, there was ample room to dance, and the sound wasnt painfully loud. It was just right. The LED panels on the ceilings was cool too!  Overall it was a much better experience.

I'm relatively new to churning and I'm trying to figure out what credit card to now use for our family's daily driver. I know this goes against the spirit of churning, but my wife doesn't want to have to deal with multiple credit cards to use. Our plan is to buy everything this year on a card and pay it off monthly.  I just received the CSR card a few months back and got the sign-up bonus. I also have the Chase Southwest Premier card and have used it to obtain CP towards the end of 2015 and 2016 through the sign-up bonus and the amount of travel I do on Southwest for work. I also earned CP through 2017 again through Southwest travel and some big remodeling expenses we put on the card.   If my goal is to obtain SW CP again for 2018 while just using one card, seems like the easiest way  would be to just put all our daily charges on the SW card for this year, correct?  ",

It was a bit crowded and a girl was standing next to the wall, kind of blocking the way (but you could just go around her with no issue). The guy literally pushed her violently and said \"go away bitch\" along with the most over-inflated-ego face one could imagine, hand gestures [like that](https://edschultzmsnbc.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/wright1.jpg) and so on.

We went to see a 10am showing of the new movie on Memorial Day (followed that night by marathoning Arrested Development season 4) and then I started watching TOS.  My wife was born the same month Next Generation debuted so she's literally been a Trekkie her entire life. I grew up on Star Wars, so I was always a bit reluctant, but I have to say...the more I see Star *Trek* the less I like Star *Wars*.

Setting that aside, assuming I had a Windows machine, why would I spend $150 and my time installing that when I can play the PS4 I have already? There's no advantage to me. You're proposing I take my computer, put it in my bedroom, hook it up to my TV, install this video card, install whatever I need to get my dualshock controller to work, install the game, and then deal with any adjustments, tweaks, and conflicts that arise plus install patches. And, I had to buy the game for PC, too. Probably need a Bluetooth dongle to communicate with the controller. Maybe not, but maybe. And, all of this assumes it will actually match the performance of the PS4  Or, I could buy the game, insert the disc, and play the PS4 I already have as is. And it's small, black, unobtrusive and my wife doesn't complain about it.  By the way, I don't have anything against others enjoying PC games. But, it's not for me, and I imagine this is exactly what OP was trying to say.",

You can just solder to the points on the bottom of the board and leave the stock AV port alone.  I also added a higher capacity battery holder to one of my Saturns. I just soldered a 2xAA battery holder to the battery terminals on the bottom of the Saturn motherboard. [Basically I did this.](http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?43561-Long-life-battery-box-mod-for-Sega-Saturn) This gives me about 10 times the standard capacity of the stock CR2032 battery. According to [the battery FAQ](http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?9053-Sega-Saturn-long-life-battery), the CR2032 provides about one to two years with normal use or ninteen days when the unit is unplugged. So with the battery mod, battery should now last about 10 years when plugged in!  Any time my wife says something about my video game collection, I mention her shoe collection and then she doesn't complain anymore :)",
