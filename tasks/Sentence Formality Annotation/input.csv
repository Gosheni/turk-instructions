THis is a huge claim . Back it up,,244303,The longer you ignore the harder it gets to fix . The problem is already real and it is just being ignored ... just look at the news stories covering the financial statements ( or lack thereof ) . Congress is too short sighted to worry about long term problems .,,271113,"1 ) The faculty advisor could have had no problem with it . As hard as this may be to believe , not everybody caters to a homophobic tendency ... Again , I reject the notion that the only response other than homophilia is homophobia . Unless you recognize that there people are capable of approaching an issue with something other than love or hate , there is no room for rational argument . It is a common misconception that &apos;&apos; - phobia &apos;&apos; means just `` fear &apos;&apos; . Xenophobia means `` fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign &apos;&apos; Homophobia means &apos;&apos; irrational fear of , aversion to , or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals &apos;&apos; I have seen a couple of research articles which explicitly states that the majority of people who have homophobia fall under the `` aversion to , or discrimination against &apos;&apos; category and not really the `` irrational fear of &apos;&apos; category . If that is the case we have a poor use of language rather than a common misconception . I am averse to sugary cereals , but I do not fear them . Homophobia has a very clear Greek root meaning of fear . The claustrophobe does not discriminate against enclosed spaces , he is afraid of them . Phobic implies fear , it does not imply discrimination . One may act out of fear , but it does not necessarily follow that ones actions must be taken out of fear . But only the homosexual kiss , and not the heterosexual groping on the EXACT OPPOSITE PAGE . Does n&apos;t that say something to you ? Not wild about the groping either . Thank you for the opportunity to clarify . Quote : Your analogy is not parallel enough to really capture the situation . It &apos;s not just `` owning a cat &apos;&apos; , but rather people are making a sweeping decision that cat pictures may not be present in a yearbook . They blacked out a cat picture in a yearbook as inappropriate , ignoring the multiple dog pictures which are nearby . If they did n&apos;t want to buy a yearbook because they did n&apos;t want a picture of a cat , that is one thing . But to deny everybody an opportunity to buy the yearbook with the picture of a cat in it ? That is an entirely different matter . I changed my mind . I hate cats . Dogs too . I am an equal opportunity proponent of quadriped hatred . Ahh . So you liken homosexuality to swearing then , eh ? And heterosexuality ? Would that be closer to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance ? Both behaviors adults take part in . Neither of which are appropriate for 14 year olds . If you believe that I am likening the two , you may use your logic to also liken homosexuality to cigars , fine wine , and real estate if it makes you feel better . Your claim of `` fact &apos;&apos; is obviously hotly contested . Or to put it another way , are you freakin &apos; kidding me ? These kids can turn on any TV and watch a LOT more intense action than just a casual kiss . These kids can buy a variety of magazines off the rack that include more intense action than just a casual kiss . Are you of the mind that we should also go through their World History books to ensure that there are n&apos;t any pictures of `` art &apos;&apos; which does n&apos;t have an appropriate level of clothing on ? Is that the type of censorship your `` decency &apos;&apos; requires ? Or is it just the gay kiss thing you want to keep in the closet , while heterosexual equivalents are ignored ? You &apos; re treating this gay KISS like it &apos;s pornography . And no sir . That is NOT a `` fact &apos;&apos; . I am also treating this gay kiss like cigars , fine wine and real estate . There are a lot of things that kids can be exposed to outside of school . That exposure has no impact on what they should be exposed to in a gubment school which they are compelled by law to attend . Those kids may go to church on Sunday and be exposed to religious teachings . I do n&apos;t believe you would argue that Sunday exposure to church means the yearbook should include scripture .",,188667,"Well , when one is continually bashed over the head with the mantra , I will understand a bit of resentment towards religion .

Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise , they became fools , Rom 1:23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man -- and birds and four - footed animals and creeping things . Rom 1:24 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness , in the lusts of their hearts , to dishonor their bodies among themselves , Rom 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever .

I want to share with you an awesome experience I had in the Colorado House of Representatives on May 8 . It is a humbling experience to look back and realize that God used me to play a role in His divine orchestration . I was leaving the House chambers for the weekend when our Democrat speaker of the House announced that the coming Monday would be the final day of this year &apos;s General Assembly . He went on to state that there were still numerous resolutions on the calendar which we would need to be addressed prior to the summer adjournment . Interestingly , he specifically mentioned that one of the resolutions we would be hearing was being carried by the House Majority Leader Alice Madden , honoring the 90th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains . As a strong pro - life legislator I was disgusted by the idea that we would pass a resolution honoring this 90-year legacy of genocide . I drove home that night wondering what I could say that might pierce the darkness during the debate on this heinous resolution . On Saturday morning , I took my 8-year - old son up to the mountains to go white - water rafting . The trip lasted all day . As we were driving home , exhausted and hungry , I remembered that I had accepted an invitation to attend a fundraising dinner that night for a local pro - life organization . One of my most respected mentors had personally called me several weeks earlier and asked me to attend , so I knew I &apos; d have to clean up and head over . After our meal , the executive director of the organization introduced the keynote speaker . I looked up and saw walking to the stage a handicapped young lady being assisted to the microphone by a young man holding a guitar . Her name was Gianna Jessen . Gianna said `` Hello , &apos;&apos; welcomed everyone , and then sang three of the most beautiful Christian songs I have ever heard . She then began to give her testimony . When her biological mother was 17 years old and seven and a half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to have an abortion . As God would have it , the abortion failed and a beautiful 2-pound baby girl was brought into the world . Unfortunately , she was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors thought that she would never survive . The doctors were wrong . Imagine the timing ! A survivor of a Planned Parenthood abortion arrived in town just days before the Colorado House of Representatives was to celebrate Planned Parenthood &apos;s `` wonderful &apos;&apos; work . As I listened to Gianna &apos;s amazing testimony , the Lord inspired me to ask her if she could stay in Denver until Monday morning so that I could introduce her on the floor of the House and tell her story . Perhaps she could even begin the final day &apos;s session by singing our country &apos;s national anthem ! To my surprise she said she would seriously consider it . If she were to agree , she wanted her accompanying guitarist to stay as well . A lady standing in line behind me waiting to meet Gianna overheard our conversation and said that she would be willing to pay for the guitarist &apos;s room . Gianna then said that she would think about it . As I was driving home from the banquet , my cell phone rang . It was Gianna , and she immediately said , `` I &apos; m in , let &apos;s ruin this celebration . &apos;&apos; Praise God ! When Monday morning came , I awoke at 6 a.m. to write my speech before heading to the Capitol . As I wrote down the words , I could sense God &apos;s help and I knew that this was going to be a powerful moment for the pro - life movement . Following a committee hearing , I rushed into the House chambers just as the opening morning prayer was about to be given . Between the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance , I wrote a quick note to the speaker of the House explaining that Gianna is an advocate for cerebral palsy . I took the note to the speaker and asked if I could have my friend open the last day of session by singing the national anthem . Without any hesitation the speaker took the microphone and said , `` Before we begin , Representative Harvey has made available for us Gianna Jessen to sing the national anthem . &apos;&apos; Gianna sang the most amazing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that you could possibly imagine . Every person in the entire chamber was completely still , quiet and in awe of this frail young lady &apos;s voice . Due to her cerebral palsy , Gianna often loses her balance , and shortly after starting to sing she grabbed my arm to stabilize herself , and I could tell that she was shaking . Suddenly , midway through the song , she forgot the words and began to hum and then said , `` Please forgive me ; I am so nervous . &apos;&apos; She then immediately began singing again and every House member and every guest throughout the chambers began to sing along with her to give her encouragement and to lift her up . As I looked around the huge hall I listened to the unbelievable melody of Gianna &apos;s voice being accompanied by a choir of over 100 voices . I had chills running all over my body , and I knew that I had just witnessed an act of God . As the song concluded the speaker of the House explained that Gianna has cerebral palsy and is an activist to bring awareness to the disease . `` Let us give her a hand not only for her performance today , but also for her advocacy work , &apos;&apos; he said . The chamber immediately exploded into applause -- she had them all in the palm of her hand . The speaker then called the House to order , and we proceeded as usual to allow members to make any announcements or introductions of guests . For dramatic effect , I waited until I was the last person remaining before I introduced Gianna . As I waited for my turn , I nervously paced back and forth praying to God that he would give me the peace , confidence and the courage necessary to pull off what I knew would be one of the most dramatic and controversial moments of my political career . While I waited , a prominent reporter from one of the major Denver newspapers walked over to Gianna and told her that her rendition captured the spirit of the national anthem more powerfully than any she had ever heard before . Finally , I was the last person remaining . So , I proceeded to the microphone and began my speech . Members , I would like to introduce you to a new friend and hero of mine -- her name is Gianna Jessen . She is visiting us today from Nashville , Tennessee , where she is an accomplished recording artist . She has cerebral palsy and was raised in foster homes before being adopted at the age of four She was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds at birth . She remained in the hospital for almost three months . A doctor once said she had a great will to live and that she fought for her life . Eventually she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care . Because of her cerebral palsy , her foster mother was told that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or walk . She could not sit up independently . Through the prayers and dedication of her foster mother , she eventually learned to sit up , crawl , then stand . Shortly before her fourth birthday , she began to walk with leg braces and a walker . She continued in physical therapy and after a total of four surgeries , she was able to walk without assistance . She still falls sometimes , but she says she has learned how to fall gracefully after falling for 29 years . Two years ago , she walked into a local health club and said she wanted a private trainer . At the time her legs could not lift 30 pounds . Today she can leg press 200 pounds . She became so physically fit that she began running marathons to raise money and awareness for cerebral palsy . She just returned last week from England where she ran in the London Marathon . It took her more than eight - and-a-half hours to complete . They were taking down the course by the time she made it to the finish line . But she made it , nonetheless . With bloody feet and aching joints , she finished the race . Members would you help me recognize a modern - day hero -- Gianna Jessen ? At this point the chamber exploded into applause which lasted for 15-to-20 seconds . Gianna had touched their souls . Ironically , Alice Madden , the majority leader and sponsor of the Planned Parenthood resolution , walked over to Gianna and congratulated her . As the applause began to die down , I raised my hand to be recognized one more time . Mr. Speaker , members , if you would allow me just a few more moments I would appreciate your time . My name is Ted Harvey , not Paul Harvey , but , please , let me tell you the rest of the story . The cause of Gianna &apos;s cerebral palsy is not because of some biological freak of nature , but rather the choice of her mother . You see when her biological mother was 17-years - old and 7-and - a-half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to seek a late - term abortion . The abortionist performed a saline abortion on this 17-year - old girl . This procedure requires the injection of a high concentration of saline into the mother &apos;s womb , which the fetus is then bathed in and swallows , which results in the fetus being burned to death , inside and out . Within 24 hours the results are normally an induced , still - born abortion . As Gianna can testify , the procedure is not always 100 percent effective . Gianna is an aborted late - term fetus who was born alive . The high concentration of saline in the womb for 24 hours resulted in a lack of oxygen to her brain and is the cause of her cerebral palsy . Members , today , we are going to recognize the 90th anniversary of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood ... &apos;&apos; BANG ! The gavel came down . Just as I was finishing the last sentence of my speech -- the climax of the morning -- the speaker of the House gaveled me down and said , `` Representative Harvey , I will allow you to continue your introduction , but not for the purposes of debating a measure now pending before the House . &apos;&apos; At which point I said , `` Mr. Speaker , I understand . I just wanted to put a face to what we are celebrating today . &apos;&apos; Silence . Deafening silence . I then walked back to my chair shaking like a leaf . The Democrats would n&apos;t look at me . They were fuming . It was beautiful . I have been in the Legislature for five tough years , and this made it all worthwhile . The House majority leader would n&apos;t talk to me the rest of the day . Was it because I introduced an abortion survivor , or was it because we touched her soul ? She could congratulate an inspirational cerebral palsy victim and advocate , but was outraged when she discovered that the person she congratulated was also an abortion survivor . The headline in The Denver Post the next day read `` Abortion Jab Earns Rebuke . &apos;&apos; The majority leader is quoted as saying , `` I think it was amazingly rude to use a human being as an example of his personal politics . &apos;&apos; Yes , Representative Madden , Gianna Jessen is a human being . She was when she was in her mother &apos;s womb , and she was when she sang the national anthem on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives . The paper went on to quote Gianna , stating she was glad I told her story . `` We need to discuss the humanity of it . I &apos; m glad to be able to speak up for children in the womb , &apos;&apos; she said . `` If abortion is about women &apos;s rights , where were my rights ? &apos;&apos; All I can say is , `` Glory to God ! &apos;&apos; He orchestrated it all , every minute of it , and I was so honored to have been chosen to play a part . May we all continue to be filled with and to fight for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ !",

Economic liberalization , including reduced controls on foreign trade and investment , began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country &apos;s growth , which has averaged more than 7 % per year since 1997 . India &apos;s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming , modern agriculture , handicrafts , a wide range of modern industries , and a multitude of services . Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture , but services are the major source of economic growth , accounting for more than half of India &apos;s output , with only one - third of its labor force . India has capitalized on its large educated English - speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers . An industrial slowdown early in 2008 , followed by the global financial crisis , led annual GDP growth to slow to 6.1 % in 2009 , still second highest growth in the world among major economies . India escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis because of cautious banking policies and a relatively low dependence on exports for growth . Domestic demand , driven by purchases of consumer durables and automobiles , has re - emerged as a key driver of growth , as exports have fallen since the global crisis started . India &apos;s fiscal deficit increased substantially in 2008 due to fuel and fertilizer subsidies , a debt waiver program for farmers , a job guarantee program for rural workers , and stimulus expenditures . The government abandoned its deficit target and allowed the deficit to reach 6.8 % of GDP in FY10 . Nevertheless , as shares of GDP , both government spending and taxation are among the lowest in the world . The government has expressed a commitment to fiscal stimulus in FY10 , and to deficit reduction the following two years . It has increased the pace of privatization of government - owned companies , partly to offset the deficit .

Most progressive people who have `` actually peeked behind the curtain &apos;&apos; have come to learn that gays are just like anybody else for the most part and are , for the most part , totally harmless to society . These progressive people have no problem , whatsoever , in letting the gays take their rightful place in society with all due rights and privileges afforded to any other , tax paying , law abiding , adult citizen . In my opinion , regarding the regressives , it &apos;s simply a matter of lack of understanding and education and the reluctance to be taught . It &apos;s a matter of sticking one &apos;s fingers in one &apos;s ears and screaming `` LALALALALALALALALA &apos;&apos; I DO N&apos;T HEAR YOU ! !

( Twenty years ago , `` XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy &apos;&apos; would have never been accepted . ) The Regressives who adamantly fear this change in society are going to great lengths to anchor their belief and moral system into a constitutional vault to disable our society from evolving further or even considering the issue . Even if their actions are nothing less than facist . I think their take on it is `` Desperate times require desperate measures and if that means facism , then so be it . &apos;&apos; The only thing is , the gay issues before us all as a society do NOT equate to `` desperate times . &apos;&apos; We have people blowing themselves up , starving , hurricanes and yet some folks focus on gays marrying ?

The quality of the loan is analogous to the deliciousness of the fruit . Customers do not have the right to any quality of merchandise including any particular quality of loan . They have a right to have any terms they agree to honored , they have an obligation to pay only if the product traded was the one discussed . ` Regulations &apos; about financial terms are totally acceptable , regulations about what securities could be sold is not . Giving a legal definition for terms is hardly new and has rarely been called regulating business . Or perhaps setting a fixed price for bread is no different , they give people the confidence to know that they are n&apos;t overpaying or underselling bread . This claim of giving people confidence is a poor disguise for ripping out the beating heart of capitalism , namely the price finding system in which it is critical that both the buyers and sellers agreement settle the price . Which is why we should not print money except to replace money . That is somewhat a red herring . It is true that something has value only because we decide it does , all things are such . The reason we have decided gold is valuable is that it is rare and hard to destroy ( it does have good conductivity too ) . That money has value is not what I was calling artificial , pretending that you can maintain the ratio by obligating people to create a certain amount of wealth if they want to add a certain amount of money to the system . That could only work in an near ideal world . It is much more sane to think you could keep track of a static amount of currency than to think such a practice would reflect real accurate adjustment . neither do loans That is not possible because what may be an asset in one situation may not be in another , as I clearly showed above . No , as you just finished telling me gold has no value of it &apos;s own . Therefore how much it would be valued at in ancient rome would not be the quality of the coin but a market derived value . Observe : as you pointed out roman authorities did mint their coins all the same , which means they all had the same quality for a long time . Are you saying that the value of the coins never changed throughout roman history ? Are you saying that by producing uniform gold coins rome somehow set their empire &apos;s GDP to zero ? Then there is no problem . So you expect me to believe that for no apparent reason people just sucked up these bad loans like candy never being competent enough to check their quality ? Does n&apos;t it seem far more likely that because they thought the government was using force to stop bad loans from even going on the market they did n&apos;t check or did n&apos;t check well enough ? I doubt that in the extreme . Of course I can . People simply do not buy useless product en masse for no reason . If they do and yet the company selling the product has also been honest about every question put to them and about their advertisements and product description you expect me to believe that these people simply went insane or were too stupid to know the value of the product in the first place . In which case you are basically saying ` if people are too stupid to know what something is worth the government should regulate it &apos;s value &apos; .

As for procedures such as partial birth abortion and other attempts by the far - right to limit third term abortion , my understanding ( and granted this is from word of mouth only ) is that the legislation proposed was too general and purposely included language that opened judicial paths toward banning all abortions . For an example of this type of manipulation of law , if , in the murder of a pregnant woman , a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder ( making it a double murder ) , that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus ( at any stage ) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person .

( I dislike people calling Easyrider a `` bigot &apos;&apos; because I think it is not helpful , and it is mean - spirited . ) Even though I strongly support equal marriage rights for same - sex couples , I do not label people bigots for opposing same - sex marriage . I think that the use of such labels only divides people and does not accomplish mutual understanding . When people say they oppose same - sex marriage ( President Obama says this ) I want to understand why . People usually have reasons for the positions they hold , and calling them bigots does not help us to understand people &apos;s reasons for anything , and it certainly does not move us toward agreement or reconciliation . I have said that we need to consider each form of marriage on its own merits , to determine whether there are good reasons for banning it . There may be no reason for banning marriage between a father and daughter . That is a question that we would need to scrutinize , just as we are currently as a society scrutinizing whether there are good reasons for banning same - sex marriage . We have not had an in - depth discussion as a society of father - daughter marriages or even of cousin marriages . These need to be discussed in depth , each on its own terms . Saying that we will allow same - sex marriages should not , I think , automatically open the door to all marriages between anyone . Even saying it should open the door to all marriages between two consenting adults sets limits : they have to be two parties and they have to be adults . I think it is good that there is widespread debate and discussion over whether to legalize same - sex marriage . I think the consideration of whether this does harm to anyone is important to consider . Anyhow , before you start labeling me a `` bigot , &apos;&apos; you should bother to read MY posts , as you have accused me of failing to read yours . You will see that I have said that maybe we should legalize all marriages between any two consenting adults , but I/we need to think about this carefully . I think we as a society must consider carefully each form of marriage on its own merits . What is the harm , if any , of legalizing first - cousin marriages ? Why have they been banned in many states ? Is the perceived harm of such marriages a myth ? I do think that our default position should be individual liberty . Marriage relations should not be banned simply because a majority of people do n&apos;t like a particular form of marriage or because they believe it is `` immoral . &apos;&apos; The state should have to demonstrate that a particular form of marriage does real social harm . I think this is true of polygamy also . I think that if people want to form polygamous marriages , they should have that right , unless the state can demonstrate that there is real harm to people from such a marriage . So while I think that we must consider whether any legalization of a new form of marriage does harm to people , it should be incumbent on the state to demonstrate harm in order to be permitted to ban any form of marriage .",,341833,"One does not have to speak with a politician to hear a lie come out of his mouth .

Ayn Rand : Qua religion , no - in the sense of blind belief , belief unsupported by , or contrary to , the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason . Faith , as such , is extremely detrimental to human life : it is the negation of reason . But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy , that the first attempts to explain the universe , to give a coherent frame of reference to man &apos;s life and a code of moral values , were made by religion , before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy . And , as philosophies , some religions have very valuable moral points . They may have a good influence or proper principles to inculcate , but in a very contradictory context and , on a very - how should I say it ? - dangerous or malevolent base : on the ground of faith .

The nature of your actions - and of your ambition - will be different , according to which set of answers you come to accept . ( The Doctrine of Original Sin ) declares that ( man ) ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rational being . It was the knowledge of good and evil - he became a moral being / He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor - he became a productive being . He was sentenced to experience desire - he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment . The evils for which ( the preachers ) damn him are reason , morality , creativeness joy - all the cardinal values of his existence . The alleged short - cut to knowledge , which is faith , is only a short circuit destroying the mind . Faith is the wors curse of mankind , as the exact antithesis and enemy of thought .

Further research shows that the estrogen in soy does have some potentially disturbing side affects . The bolded sections speak directly to some very real possible side effects that if one reads WAY into them , he might be able to worry about the higher estrogen levels affecting developing boys sexuality . I &apos; m not saying I think this , but it has n&apos;t been proven that it could n&apos;t happen according to this article . http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/food/soy_story.html Soy and Reproduction : Breeding Discontent Scientists have known since the mid-1940s that phytoestrogens can impair fertility . Fertility problems in cows , sheep , rabbits , cheetahs , guinea pigs , birds , and mice have all been reported .63 , 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels , 65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido , and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands . Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally , during infancy and puberty , during pregnancy and lactation , and during the hormonal shifts of menopause . Of all these groups , infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase , and because formula is their main source of nutrient .66 , 67 A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth - the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non - breastfed babies . Normally during this period , the body surges with natural estrogens , testosterones , and other hormones that are meant to program the baby &apos;s reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood . For infants on soy formula , this programming may be interrupted.68-70 Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men . So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty , the time when a male &apos;s sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice . If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens , however , appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date , most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies , because investigations in which humans &apos; sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally can not ethically be done . However , in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace , parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all . Breasts , underdeveloped gonads , undescended testicles ( cryptorchidism ) , and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common . Sperm counts are also falling.75-79 Soy formula is bad news for girls as well . Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life , then decline and remain at low levels until puberty . With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet , an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty , such as breast development or pubic hair , before the age of three . By the age of eight , 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics .83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon .84 , 85 Most experts blame this epidemic of `` precocious puberty &apos;&apos; on environmental estrogens from plastics , pesticides , commercial meats , etc . , but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor .86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment , soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly . Since its establishment in 1974 , the federal government &apos;s Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low - income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding . Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance , black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies . Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life , including amenorrhea ( failure to menstruate ) , anovulatory cycles ( cycles in which no egg is released ) , impaired follicular development ( follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs ) , erratic hormonal surges , and other problems associated with infertility . Because the mammary glands depend on estrogen for their development and functioning , the presence of soy estrogens at a susceptible time might predispose girls to breast cancer , another condition that is on the rise and definitively linked to early puberty .87 Recently , a team of researchers headed by Brian L. Strom , MD , studied the use of soy formula and its long - term impact on reproductive health . They announced only one adverse finding : longer , more painful menstrual periods among women who &apos; d been fed soy formula in infancy .88 Dr. Strom &apos;s conclusion that the results were `` reassuring &apos;&apos; made newspaper headlines all over the world , though the data in the body of the report were anything but . Indeed , data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma , and higher rates of cervical cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , blocked fallopian tubes , and pelvic inflammatory disease .89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades , the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study . Not surprisingly , this study was funded in part by the infant - formula industry . Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens . There are other problems as well , notably much higher levels of aluminum , fluoride , and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development . Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain , toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention - deficit disorders , dyslexia , and other learning problems .97 , 98 Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk . Researchers , however , have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu , soy milk , soy protein shakes , and other soy foods.99-101 Limited evidence , however , suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health , fertility , and possibly increased risk of breast cancer . All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula , as well as estrogen - related birth defects , have occurred ( in animal studies , at least ) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy .102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias , a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft .103 Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive - tract abnormalities , infertility , and other health problems in humans , most health authorities recommend that we `` wait and see . &apos;&apos; This could be a terrible mistake . In the 1940s and 1950s , another estrogen , diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage . That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens - including soy isoflavones - but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed .104 , 105 DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens . However , the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency . When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied , they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES .106 , 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES .108 Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are `` safe &apos;&apos; because they are `` weak &apos;&apos; and `` natural . &apos;&apos; Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol , the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak .109 Though this still sounds quite weak , it is not - because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula , and by children and adults who eat soy every day . These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia . The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams , or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight . In Japan , the figures range from 10 to 28 mg , or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight . In contrast , infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones , which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight . Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months - or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month .110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants , their young bodies are still developing , and highly vulnerable to endocrine - system disruption by soy . And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies . Meanwhile , the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer . The soy industry &apos;s top scientists , convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease ( held in Orlando , Florida , September 21-24 , 2003 ) , conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory , with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful , and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer . What &apos;s certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid . Likewise , the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol ( see sidebar , `` Boon to the Industry : The FDA &apos;s Soy Protein Health Claim &apos;&apos; ) is very likely to harm the thyroid , and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease . The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven , and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M. Sheehan , formerly senior toxicologist with the FDA &apos;s National Center for Toxicological Research , has called a `` large , uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human experiment . `` 111",,287087,Makes you wonder that if someone needs it dumbed down that much then perhaps voting should not be allowed .,,35413,"Taken directly from the Liberal &apos;s playbook , you must be moving up the ranks !

MOLON LABE !,,191405,"1970 is the year Robin Morgan &apos;s anthology , Sisterhood Is Powerful , came out : its publication doubled the number of feminist books I knew about . I had begun reading deBeauvoir &apos;s Second Sex in 1967 , in self - defense ; my first husband had called me a `` feminist &apos;&apos; while we were arguing . He &apos; d said , `` You know what you are ... &apos;&apos; I discovered the word in deBeauvoir and claimed it , feeling better and more myself than ever I had before . By 1970 I was substitute - teaching in Chicago &apos;s public grade schools for work ; my second husband was working civil service at the downtown post office . Having fled flimsy middle - income high - rise housing , we &apos; d found a sunny first floor Northside flat on Gordon Terrace , a street which had once been on the lakeshore before the park and the Outer Drive had been set into place on landfill . This apartment was in a grand old Chicago house filled with woodwork and wainscoting , a third floor ballroom and several fireplaces . Eventually , this wonderful apartment , with its front bathroom and huge front bedroom , was one of the houses the Service often used for doing abortions . In 1970 , I saw an announcement in The Chicago Tribune for a National Organization of Women meeting and decided to attend . At this meeting the organizers talked about staging a cocktail party for advertising executives at which it would be our mission to convince these executives that using various female body parts to sell their products was not acceptable practice . Once again , I would be part of asking something of someone in charge : we ourselves were never those someones , and we were in charge of nothing but asking . `` Strategy &apos;&apos; was confined to trying to determine how to ask someone something effectively . To me , fighting for Women &apos;s Rights was not , is not , a matter of asking or of educating the patriarchs -- at parties or anywhere else . Appealing to members of the same group who maintain the custom of precluding rights was then , is now , simply a bad idea . `` Something real &apos;&apos; is how I characterized what I wanted to do . I asked a woman who was standing next to me at the NOW meeting , `` Is there anything real going on in Chicago for women ? This cocktail party stuff is ridiculous . I want to do something real &apos;&apos; . She chuckled , as I remember it , and asked for my phone number saying she &apos; d call me in a week or two . I thought , sure , right , but then she did call and she invited me to a meeting of women about abortion , `` if you &apos; re still interested &apos;&apos; . I said that if it were to be about making cocktails while lobbying for abortion rights , I would n&apos;t be interested . She said it was n&apos;t like that . It was n&apos;t like that . The evening in 1970 I attended my first meeting of the Abortion Counseling Service , fifteen or so white and Semitic women were gathered at someone &apos;s house . I remember sitting on the floor wondering what exactly was going on . Eventually , I remember it dawning on me ; I remember thinking , `` These women are talking about DOING abortions &apos;&apos; . I hoped that what I surmised was correct , that , indeed , no one in this group would ask me to write to congress , to lobby , to convince anyone of anything , or to wait ; maybe I was going to be able to do something real . Doing abortions with the Service has always felt that way to me : real . It is the best work I ever did .

A male simply would not have been able to survive in any such primate group , nor do I believe his seeds would have been able produce others of his type . I think the female egg is far more versatile as to what it accepts to fertilize it . In the event that the catalyst were male , I believe it would only be able to mate compatibly with its own mother . 2 . ) Only a female would be able to care for its young in a way that would allow it to survive . After having this young , she would gaurd it closely . 3 . ) It is not extremely difficult to conceive that a quasihumanoid primate would be able to exist and be fertilized by a similar specie . There are many races and creeds of people in the world today whom are all capable of crossbreeding . Black , white , spanish , eskimo , indian , etc . . . This indicates that we must all have a single common origin . 4 . ) I &apos; d like to say that the change in dynamic form was radical , retarded actually , and that all of the catalyst &apos;s offspring remained hereditary to her . Perhaps seperating completely from other primate groups . I would also venture to say that the development of our species as far as intelligence and capacity was probably a very slow process . 5 . ) Scientists generally refer to us being more like monkeys as far as IQ and build , though I believe it was apes . I think the first quasihumans were retards of an impotent ape . Segregated from ape culture , the retard children learned from momma and from observing other forms of life . The more intelligent the species became , the more versatile it became . Anyway , that is my conjecture . I am curious to know what reaction takes places when similar species of sperm and eggs meet . Does the sperm cell penetrate the egg ? Is it killed off long before ? Does it try to penetrate and fail ? Does anything happen ? My thought would be to test human sperm against different groups of primates &apos; eggs . My theory is that , if there is even a remnant in existence , that the reaction with human sperm versus the catalyst would be different than any other reaction , even if it failed to produce . I do n&apos;t really know anything about geneology , I just like to make intelligent guesses . Things to think about . =) Leviathan",,123789,"Jitobear , please be nice .

The thing is , I would suggest that any scientist who is true to principles and whom I would respect would not allow his beliefs to hinder potential genuine science . This is why I find your obvious belief in `` anti - ID &apos;&apos; scientists nonsensical because you just ca n&apos;t think of a theory having people pro or anti towards it . The best example is the current mass of theories trying to bring together quantum mechanics and relativity . I think there are about 5 or 6 theories , all of which show promise and all of which are being worked on . The problem ID has , is that it &apos;s central texts ( eg Behe &apos;s Black Box ) have been convincingly refuted as has every example of irreducible complexity . This is not because scientists have set out to disprove ID , it is because they have set out to test it . They have been presented with a concept that in theory challenges decades or centuries of hard scientific labour . So they investigate , test the theory as rigourously as any new theory , particularly controvesial ones . For example , someone suggests an example of irreducible complexity , so a bunch of biologists spend some time looking at that in detail , and learn some pretty amazing things about evolution at the genetic level , and have invariably found that what they discover does not support the ID hypothesis which is in fact what it is . Do n&apos;t see this as an insult of any kind , but the hard fact is that a hypothesis needs a substantial body of evidence to support it before it becomes a theory . ID just does not have this . In fact , in my view , the very way ID is presented just does n&apos;t sound like science ; its very foundation is the belief that some things are beyond understanding . The foundation of science is philosophy , which is an open - ended search for truth , and science is similarly open - ended ; it will never consider that anything could be unknowable . ID puts a limit on aspects of knowledge : in terms of irreducible complexity , ID ( and creationism in general ) says we can work it back to a certain point , but before that it was all God . I &apos; m sure I &apos; m not going to alter your beliefs but surely you can see that these reasons underlie the failure of ID to gain respectability within the scientific community far more than any even subconcious ` worldview bias &apos; . Again here is the crux of the matter : The fact that the ToE contradicted some specific aspects of dogma does not mean by extension that anyone was out to ` counter &apos; religion . I can say confidently that it probably contributed to the increase in atheism , but this is not deliberate on anyone &apos;s part , it is just social change . Science has offered an alternative to faith , but after that it is up to the individual to choose , either exclusively or any combination of both . The appeal of science ( at least to me ) is its exuberant , almost arrogant confidence is its determination to understand everything , able and willing to scrap everything and start again as many times as necessary , unable to conceive of giving up . It &apos;s an ambitious and awe - inspiring undertaking that we are pursuing as a species . I have only known one bloke in my life who was a total creationist . While I admit I kind of looked down on him at first , I soon realised he was an intelligent guy who just did n&apos;t see what I see in science , although to this day I ca n&apos;t fathom just why not . As almost every field of science does . In fact , it &apos;s usually the major breakthroughs that , in answering some questions , throw up new ones . But this is to be expected . You just get on with it and try and answer the new questions . Sorry , but no . The facts , if accurate , will always win out over entrenched beliefs . Again , in physics , relativity and quantum mechanics shook the foundations of knowledge but being accurate , predictive theories they gained acceptance . In relation to this , and you &apos; re not going to like me for saying this , but on a large scale , science has shaken the foundations of the oldest entrenched idea of all , that of religion . This goes back to Galileo disproving the entrenched church - sanctioned belief that the sun goes round the earth . Nobody thinks anything `` must have evolved &apos;&apos; . We have the theory , proposed by Darwin , added to by others , and we find that the vast majority of evidence supports it , particularly in the field of genetics . The concept of a supernatural cause is literally meaningless to the scientific method , but this does not entail a rejection of spirituality . It does , however entail accepting theories that describe a system to the extent that you can make all sorts of predictions about that system &apos;s behaviour . To me this seems like common sense . It does n&apos;t matter if the theories sound far - fetched , or if they contradict aspects of an entrenched belief , because if the predictions can be repeatedly and consistently demonstrated , how can you question the theory ? You can do it by coming up with a more accurate theory , but that &apos;s the only way . You ca n&apos;t do it by picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory , which , no offense , seems to be a disproprtionately large element of ID and ` creation science &apos; .

Some definitions of sound suggest that it is only sound when it is heard by humans . If we leave it at this , we &apos; re left with so many questions . What if an animal is there ? What about if you got a tape recorder ? Would it be a sound only when it was played ? What about a deaf person ? Well , at least for this one , by our first definition , our answer should be `` yes &apos;&apos; . Deaf people can pick `` sounds &apos;&apos; since sound is a vibration ( if we define it as that ) . They hear sound with their fingers . Of course , they do not `` hear &apos;&apos; as well , since the ear is much better equipped for such things . sound1 P Pronunciation Key ( sound ) n. 1 . a. Vibrations transmitted through an elastic solid or a liquid or gas , with frequencies in the approximate range of 20 to 20,000 hertz , capable of being detected by human organs of hearing . http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sound By this more appropriate definition , the tree falling in the wood does indeed make a `` sound &apos;&apos; . Matter density - it has everything to do with it . It all depends on the density of matter and energy in the Universe . It will either keep on expanding forever or it will be gravitationally slowed and will eventually collapse back on itself , sometimes called the `` big crunch &apos;&apos; . About the Atom . You &apos; re right , people since Democritus thought that the atom was the smallest thing in the Universe . And at the time , that was the definition for the smallest thing . However , we must not forget that definitions change over time . If you check the definition of it now , you will see that it says nothing of the sort in the definition . The smallest thing , as far as I know , is a singularity . I can understand what you &apos; re trying to say about the Universe . Many scientists , even today , can not fathom that the Universe is `` expanding &apos;&apos; but into nothing - which is n&apos;t something . It just does n&apos;t seem to make sense . To try to provide an answer , some said it &apos;s expanding into `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; - which is more or less now considered a fictional thing , except in Star Trek . ;) I think it &apos;s also used in M - theory , but it &apos;s just the space between branes . Other said , `` it &apos;s expanding into another dimension &apos;&apos; , which has n&apos;t proved to be too credible either . Before I go on , we want to be careful of what we mean by `` expanding &apos;&apos; . Expanding is probably even the wrong word to use . Planets , suns and solar systems are n&apos;t expanding . Even space itself is not expanding . All we know is that galaxies are moving further and further away from each other . And the further they are to us , the faster they &apos; re going . Like I have said , it is hard for us to use empirical methods to find out whether there is something `` outside &apos;&apos; . As the classic big bang theory goes , there is not spatial boundary - no point that you can go to and say , hey ! this is the boundary ! However , although there is no spatial boundary , evidence suggests that it is spatially finite . Refer to the analogy with a 2d ant on a 3d model above . The thing about multiple dimensions and multiverses is that they &apos; re all well and good but all such ideas are currently not testable and so can not be regarded as anything more than speculation . We ca n&apos;t really say anything about them - and there are too many questions that arise . There is a lot of possibility , but no common understanding - more like science fiction . We can say that there are other `` universes &apos;&apos; that all exist in `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; , but we really have no reason to believe so . If time began at the big bang , then what ? Are there different dimensions of time for different Universes ? What happens when two Universes `` expand into each other &apos;&apos; ? Is `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; infinite ? Just how do you intend on reaching it if there is no possible access to it ? Like I said , the Universe is curved .

I would credit a hunter - gatherer as an expert on tracks . No need to have a PhD . However , leaving aside your obsession with degree qualifications , a biologist might have specialised in dentition , and I would not suggest that this would qualify them to give expert comment on tracks . You simply assume that he is a biologist who a ) studied tracks or animal locomotion ( in his degree ) and b ) geology as he comments on both . If he &apos; d grown up in the bush , with frequent recourse to hunting , I &apos; d have accepted him as an ` expert &apos; on tracks . I made no stated assumptions , other then I feel that if he has n&apos;t listed his qualifications it is because he &apos;s not qualified . I agree that this is an assumption on my part , for he may well be an ` expert in tracks &apos; . If he is , I would concede this point . But I stated from the beginning that I came to this article as it is , and on reading it , judged it as it is . If you are aware of other articles that expand on his qualifications you would have saved a lot of time by quoting them earlier ... so that these articles could be presented and judged . As it stands you just make an assumption about these qualifications , and I ca n&apos;t , as I &apos; ve not seen the evidence ... Funny that you &apos; re the evolutionist basing your beliefs on faith , and I &apos; m the creationist demanding to see the evidence . He has published numerous articles , therefore he is an expert , is the argument you make now . Let &apos;s again look to what he did when fresh out of university , he stated he was a biologist . Full stop , nothing else . He then studied the tracks , and has published on them . You raise him to ` expert &apos; , when right from the beginning he fails to live up to this . You try the ` numbers &apos; game ... a lot of people agree , therefore it &apos;s true , a lot of articles written , therefore they &apos; re true . Should you finally produce some conclusive evidence , say , his qualifications , then this matter might be resolved - excepting that you &apos; ve been holding out on nothing but faith all this time . It is because you are giving him abilities that he has not stated . He quite simply says ... student of biology . To you that means he &apos;s qualified to give expertise not only on track formation , but geology as well . In fact , you &apos; ve retrospectively given him the mantle of expert . If he &apos;s been studying tracks 50 years , or so , I wo n&apos;t specify a specific time , he could be said to be an expert ... but fresh out of university , he made these conclusions , and he &apos;s not wavered . He was , then , an expert from day 1 ( according to you ) . And , according to you he &apos;s able to detect human involvement - that is forgery . You base this simply on the wish that it was so . You said clearly ... Quite clearly you are arguing that , aside from being a lone voice on the issue , other people have come to the same conclusions , you even suggested most creationists , but fail to site any evidence to support that later claim . I am still waiting . It is all well and good of you to try to suggest something about the minds of creationists , but I &apos; m afraid that mind - reading is not my forte . You make so many just - so statements and expect people to believe it . He has done the same , and you believe him . You are making arguments based on numbers . Are they given to making the same just - so arguments he makes ? Just because he &apos;s no expert , and writes a dozen articles , does n&apos;t make him any more an expert . Others doing the same thing , if that is what is happening , equally adds no weight to the argument . 1 x1 x1 x1 is still one , no matter how many 1 &apos;s you add to it , it just does n&apos;t get bigger . What qualifications do they have ? What writings have they presented ? Are the people making the claims about man - made tracks less qualified ? You seem to think so . Indeed , a just - so statement was made , and accepted by you unless you are prepared to show me the creationist sites you &apos; ve read this on . Are they representative of all creationists ? I am a creationist , I do n&apos;t have a web - site ... how was my opinion factored into the equation ? Many of my friends equally are creationists , and none of them have web - sites either . I do n&apos;t believe that they were polled . I &apos; ll go check , I do n&apos;t want to make an assumption as you have . ( they also have n&apos;t posted on web - site debts - so you &apos; re ability to read their minds astounds me ) . You tell me your criteria for surveying , and I can tell if it &apos;s enough . Otherwise it &apos;s another just - so argument that you simply take as ` fact &apos; . Ah , now we &apos; re not talking about creationists , but creationist experts . You say that there &apos;s no qualification to being a track expert , so how are you going to figure out which creationists to ask ? He generally refers not to experts , but creationists in general ... `` By this time a growing number of creationists were becoming disenchanted with Baugh?s methods and claims ... &apos;&apos; Which is it you are talking about ? Not at all . I &apos; ve already dealt with this statement of his , and found it rather naive for him to think that any right - thinking person would believe it to be so ... it is the type of thing you believe - that a scientist is above personal bias . Logic says this fella is a biologist with an evolutionists bent . He claims that he was prepared to go along and make a judgement that might have undermined all notions of Darwinism ( with regards time - scale ) that he &apos; d ever been taught . I am making an assumption here , but it seems so ludicrous that he would be that sort of exceptional person , especially in light of the fact that he &apos;s prepared to comment on factors he &apos;s not stated he &apos;s an expert in . It just seems too arrogant . I am assuming that he , like you makes just - so arguments to be factual . Very likely he makes assumptions based on numbers of ` experts &apos; rather than facts ... though this of course is just a guess on my part . Based on what expertise ? As I said earlier , if a creationist scientist comments outside his field , he is lampooned . You see no problem with this biologist making comments on geology ... even if he studied it , he would n&apos;t necessarily be an expert . I studied Irish , and I ca n&apos;t speak it . Nil thuigimm e. * You give him credit simply based on the fact that he &apos;s a scientist , and he &apos;s published a work that agree with you ... so you add in details that are n&apos;t present . He may well have studied tracks all his life , I do n&apos;t know . He does n&apos;t state this , and as I said at the very beginning , I am only able to judge this work by the work itself . You have some special insight that transcends my capabilities . He said some of the tracks were dinosaur tracks , but also some were forged , and some were geological depressions . Even within the category of dinosaur tracks , some were straight out caused by dinosaurs tails , some by their snouts , and `` Some were mud - collapsed &apos;&apos; dinosaur tracks . Which is what I stated earlier , a whole range of phenomena were concerned in the creation of these ` tracks &apos; besides the normal phenomena for the agreed dinosaur tracks . This is quite extraordinary , as well , he seems to have stumbled on a dinosaur which just happens to have a special walking gait to account for these other ` tracks &apos; . You then argue that even if he was n&apos;t an expert , he collaborated with a whole lot of other people , who must have been experts * I &apos; ve got `` Teach Yourself Gaelic &apos;&apos; plus all the notes etc from university , and I &apos; m still unable to converse",

This is not about racism , but about the sad state of affairs within the Black community . It is no more or no less than what Bill Cosby has stated . Blacks comprise only app . 13 % of America &apos;s population yet : 1 . That 13 % accounts for 80 % of all violent crime . 2 . The number one cause of death in Black males between the ages of 17 and 40 is gun - shot wounds . 3 . That same 13 % of the population comprises 50 % of all new aids cases in America . 4 . One half of that 13 % ( Black males ) make up over 40 % of America &apos;s prison population . I could go on and on , but to what end ? The truth is that there is a huge problem in the Black community with drugs and crime . I personally do not believe that poverty is the root cause of crime . There may be many excuses for these problems , but very few real reasons . Some people just do n&apos;t give a damn about themselves or other people and intend to prove it . I believe that a lack of decent morals and rampant drug abuse in the Black community is at the root of most of their problems . The fact that 70 % of the children born in the Black community are illegitimate bolsters my theory that a lack of decent morals is prevalent in that community . I believe that liberals are largely the cause of these problems . President Johnson &apos;s Great Society comes to mind as one of the greatest failures in American history . Affirmative action and welfare does not liberate , it enslaves people . That failed social exercise made a whole race of Americans quit caring about themselves and their families . The solution to the problem is within the heart of every individual regardless of their skin color . Throwing money at these problems only makes things worse .

I know something about this topic ( and I &apos; m running for our school board next year ) . Schools are failing those children who are being failed at home . What does that mean exactly ? Look at the situation . Why do we have 4.0 gpa honor students from ghetto schools attending Harvard ? Why do we have 1.5 gpa students from rich white suburban school districts failing classes ? Why do kids that attend private schools do better then public school kids statistically ? Its the home . I &apos; ll use two kids as an example . One we &apos; ll call Darin ( ME ) . Darin grew up in a middle - upper income house . His parents both worked and money while tight was n&apos;t in short supply . Darin went to public schools in a middle income neighborhood . When he got home he had to study and do homework before anything else . Even though he was a `` latch - key &apos;&apos; kid and he came home to an empty house Darin made use of his time and managed his schoolwork . If there was something he did n&apos;t understand he &apos; d wait til his folks got home and ask them . Darin went on to graduate from high school and entered the US Navy as a `` Nuc &apos;&apos; on submarines . After six years he was discharged and went to college . He earned above average grades and joined MENSA . Leaving college he started a home - based web services company while working nights at a Walmart as a stocker . His business grew and he eventually quit Walmart . He now has a nice house , 12 employees and a successful company with some very hi - profile customers . Now let &apos;s talk about Darins best friend Brian ( MY FRIEND ) . Brian had two parents who while living together really did n&apos;t seem to have a clue . He lived in a nice house ( same floorplan as Darins in fact ) and his parents made about the same money as Darins . He went to the same schools and had the same teachers most of the time . Yet Brian never excelled . He scored higher then Darin on tests ( he was very smart ) but he just did n&apos;t work at anything . He fumbled through jr . high , started drugs and was arrested several times . Eventually he dropped out of high school and at this time he STILL lives with his parents and cleans office buildings at night part - time . OK , two kids , same IQ ( or close ) , same schools , same teachers , same financial situation ... ... . . two very different outcomes . Darin did well because of his parents . They taught him the value of an education and ALWAYS made sure it was a priority . They accepted the responsibility for having a child and raised him with morals , a sense of duty and responsibility . Darin learned the value of hardwork from his father who earned his BS at age 44 and his mother who went back to school in her early 50 &apos;s to become an RN . Darin carried this sense of responsibility into school each day . Brian on the other hand had two parents who were `` average &apos;&apos; at best . They really did n&apos;t watch out for Brian ( or his brother and sister who are also as messed up as he is ) and did n&apos;t press him to do anything . So absorbed in thier own lives they had some kids and then forgot about them . They never sat down and talked to them . They never helped them with homework . They never instilled that sense of `` I CAN &apos;&apos; into them . It would be easy to blame the schools for Brians failure but we really ca n&apos;t . Keep in mind we have situations like this in poor districts as well . Some kids , raised by a single mother , who end up going to Yale or Harvard ; while other kids at the SAME SCHOOL end up in prison or dead . It &apos;s got nothing to do with schools and teachers and money . It has everything to do with PARENTING .

If he is unable to do either , then I &apos; d guess that he was n&apos;t being underpaid and was being paid at a rate , determined by a free market , to be commensurate with the skill level required for the job . ( In actuality , that &apos;s not entirely true . The existence of a minimum wage law tampers with the free market . ) Right now , there are more government workers than those employed in manufacturing . In my society , 100 % of able - bodied adults would be responsible for the upkeep of the Federal gov ` t. Those that can afford to pay their share of the bill = 1/200 , 000,000 of the Federal budget ( not counting kids ) can pay it in cash . For example , if we set the Federal Budget at $ 1Trillion , your fair share would be $ 5000 . If you can afford $ 5000 , then you pay it in cash . If you ca n&apos;t , you work for Uncle Sam at a rate of say $ 10/hr , so that &apos;s 500 hours of service , maximum . That &apos;s less than 10 hours per week to pay your fair share of running the country . Today , the average worker works until some date in May to pay his taxes , so this is a net savings of time and money . The added benefit of my plan is the displacement of Federal employees . Imagine the number of Federal Employees that would be replaced with , essentially , free labor . That would further reduce the cost to run the Federal Government which would reduce the individual &apos;s share of the burden which would further lower the number of hours of mandatory service . Variations of the theme could be employers getting some `` free labor &apos;&apos; from someone paying their fair share and the employer paying Uncle Sam . Huh ? What sort of nonsense are you saying ? A job &apos;s value is determined by the wage in which it pays . If it does n&apos;t pay `` enough &apos;&apos; in a free market , then it goes unfilled . The fact that it &apos;s filled says that someone believes that it &apos;s a fair wage . So , in the beginning of the paragraph , you state that the employer pays the lowest possible rate but at the end of the paragraph you say that promotions and raises distort the free market by making the employee NOT want to leave . WOW ! emoticon_wow What the hell are you saying ? The free market is n&apos;t maintained because good workers are compensated at a higher rate than they were initially paid ? Does n&apos;t that indicate that their value to the employer went up and therefore to keep them , so did their wages ? That &apos;s exactly what a free market does . It rewards performance . Monopolies are n&apos;t necessarily bad things . Utility companies have monopolies and until fairly recently , so did the phone company . These were granted to promote growth in the electric and telephone grid . If there were no monopolies , would electric companies compete to run 5 miles of cable to a single house in the middle of nowhere ? Of course not . By giving a company a monopoly WITH STRINGS , companies were able to undertake non - profitable tasks as long as they made a profit overall . Without the monopoly , that house would still be in the dark . ( I know , lots of money came from the REA ) The biggest problem with public education is that it IS a monopoly ... but that &apos;s a topic for another thread .

A : Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time . That this happens is a fact . Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors . The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic , fossil , anatomical , etc . -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact . The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution . So evolution is both a fact and a theory . &apos;&apos; http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs - qa.html Here &apos;s another ... `` A century &apos;s accumulation of such evidence establishes descent , with modification , from common ancestors as a fact of science .

Evolution is taught as being true . The arguments against teaching creation in schools in part rested on the ` truthfulness &apos; of evolution . That &apos;s what evolutionists in general argue . Specifically , here &apos;s what you two have said ... Post 28 you use an analogy to show that regardless of the theories , the fact ( in this case , geese fly south ) happens to be true .

In fact he &apos;s said it so many times in so many ways that he believes I have faith - which for him is based on lack of evidence , again implying he knows the opposite of faith ; fact , based on the evidence .

You are citing the unknown as somehow proving your conjectures . There are two explanations for Pearl Harbor . One is plausible : Sheer ineptitude and a mixture of luck . The other is fantastic and without historical precedent . A discerning evaluator would demand incontrovertible proof of the latter before disregarding the former . Actually they are . If the oil tanks at Pearl Harbor had been destroyed , the US fleet would have been forced to withdraw to the mainland for lack of fuel . You are also assuming that FDR had full knowledge that the carrier attack was not including an amphibious assault force to take the islands after the raid struck . Essentially , FDR would have had to sit down with Yamamoto and chat about the entire war plan for him to set things up as nicely as it turned out . Consider this : It is extemely difficult even under the best circumstances to coordinate military operations with close allies . What you and the conspiracists are arguing is that FDR was able to achieve a level of stragetic and tactical planning that is without precedent with an adversary . Sorry , reading a few isolated intercepts does n&apos;t allow you to build that kind of time frame . FDR no doubt knew that Japan was up to no good . That is why he concentrated the fleet at Pearl Harbor - as a precaution and a deterrent . Throughout history other navies have done the exact same thing : Gather their forces at an advanced base to deter attack . Pearl was felt to be safely out of range for Japanese attack and the concentration of all those battleships was thought enough to deter aggression . Right . And what in those orders implicates American commanders or FDR with pefect foreknowledge of the attack ? There was clearly a feeling that the Japanese were up to something and naval forces were instructed to increase vigilance . The problem was that there was a breakdown of communications . The warnings about possible fleet movements were n&apos;t communicated or acted upon adequately . Many assumed Japan was either bluffing or moving against another target ( which she was ) . Motive plays a huge part in all this , because your entire argument is based on FDR &apos;s motives . As I said , I do n&apos;t agree with much of FDR &apos;s policies , but I &apos; ve read enough about the man to know he was 100 percent Navy .

Here it is again , &apos;&apos; ... there could not have been a census in Judaea before 6 A.D. , since the province had not entered direct Roman control before then . In contrast , we know that such control always entailed a census , because it initiated Roman direct taxation for which the census existed . Since Quirinius is the first Roman magistrate to control the province , we expect a census to occur at that time . So we expect a census in 6 A.D. , and not before . &apos;&apos; ( source ) Now , can you show how ` the region was clearly under Rome &apos;s control &apos; ? Thanks ! No . I am simply applying logic to the situation to determine a reasonable conclusion . Luke says that Jesus was born during the census when Quirinius governed Syria . If we take what we know about when the Roman Empire conducted censuses and take what we know about the governorship of Syria , it is certainly reasonable to conclude that the census Luke refers to is the census that took place in A.D. 6 , when Quirinius became governor of Syria . Tell me why it is reasonable to conclude anything else ? Please do . It will be interesting to see what it says . ( Of course , Carrier &apos;s article referenced above already shows that it is extremely unlikely that Quirinius could have been governor twice . ) EF ... tell me what your story is . Was Quirinius governor twice ? Or was Luke simply referring to a different census and chose to use a consul named Quirinius to identify the census instead of the governor at the time ? And if this is the case ... is there any evidence of such a census ? To me , it seems that you are grasping at straws to make so that Luke is referring to some unknown census other than the census that we know that took place when Quirinius became governor of Syria . And why are you trying to make these claims again ? ? ? Oh yeah ... it &apos;s because if Luke was actually referring to the census when Quirinius was governor of Syria ... it would mean that Luke &apos;s account conflicts with Matthew &apos;s account of the nativity . You know what ? A much more logical explanation is that either Luke or Matthew was mistaken as to WHEN Jesus was born . ( This is , of course , assuming that the gospel Jesus actually WAS born . ) Hang on , though ... we ca n&apos;t actually admit that Luke or Matthew was mistaken , can we ?

Humans and bacteria obviously share a much more distant common ancestor , but our relationship to these single - celled organisms is no less real .

I simply assert that a case for her `` being racist &apos;&apos; has not been established . You provide me an isolated statement and assert the case for her being racist . How is it racist ? Here , below , is just some of the context of what she said , from the link I provided in my earlier post ( page five ) . I understand her as speaking about her understanding of discrimination , as a Latina woman , and the related need for Latinas and women on the bench . She is speaking at UC Berkeley School of Law in a Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture in 2001 ; the lecture published in a law journal issue on `` Raising the Bar : Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and the Struggle for Representation . &apos;&apos; Obviously , as you read , her audience includes young people of all backgrounds whom she wishes to inspire to more sensitivity and understanding of discrimination . It could perhaps be seen as awkwardly worded , but I think her intent is to communicate a desire for people of all backgrounds to live up to the best of what their experiences have given them -- their ability to be wisely informed and thus guided ; their unique experience based insights . And , she wishes minorities and women to know that they have something very valuable to contribute , based on their experiences as minorities or women . ---------------- In our private conversations , Judge Cedarbaum has pointed out to me that seminal decisions in race and sex discrimination cases have come from Supreme Courts composed exclusively of white males . I agree that this is significant but I also choose to emphasize that the people who argued those cases before the Supreme Court which changed the legal landscape ultimately were largely people of color and women . I recall that Justice Thurgood Marshall , Judge Connie Baker Motley , the first black woman appointed to the federal bench , and others of the NAACP argued Brown v. Board of Education . Similarly , Justice Ginsburg , with other women attorneys , was instrumental in advocating and convincing the Court that equality of work required equality in terms and conditions of employment . Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences , a possibility I abhor less or discount less than my colleague Judge Cedarbaum , our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging . Justice O&apos;Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases . I am not so sure Justice O&apos;Connor is the author of that line since Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court Justice Coyle . I am also not so sure that I agree with the statement . First , as Professor Martha Minnow has noted , there can never be a universal definition of wise . Second , I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n&apos;t lived that life . Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society . Until 1972 , no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case . I , like Professor Carter , believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group . Many are so capable . As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me , nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown . However , to understand takes time and effort , something that not all people are willing to give . For others , their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others . Other simply do not care . Hence , one must accept the proposition that a difference there will be by the presence of women and people of color on the bench .

WikiAnswers - What year did homosexual become a word Prove this claim with actual historical records rather than a homosexual apologetics site if you can .

Here &apos;s Leviticus 20:13 , follow the same procedure : Blue Letter Bible - Lev 20 ( WLC ) I actually agree with this paragraph to an extent . I agree that the sin which God condemned in Sodom and Gomorrah was because of rampant unnatural sex acts which were practiced by heterosexuals as well as homosexuals . It was general debauchery which He destroyed the cities for . Christianity does n&apos;t teach that it was just a punishment purely against homosexuals . And it &apos;s true that we live in the age of grace rather than the age of the law now .

Read their true meaning according to the original greek and see just how dishonest your cut and paste is in light of the actual translations of the words true meanings .

And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I &apos; ve already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible ? No it is n&apos;t . The problem with translations is that when someone uses the word Agape in greek , the greeks get a complete thought of a self sacrificial love which a Father has for His children .

That is why different english versions use different , but similar meaning words in order to capture the original meaning in the original language .

You need to study up on the Hebrew word for `` day &apos;&apos; ( yom ) to see it can mean eons of time . For instance , a literal 24 hour `` day &apos;&apos; does not make sense according to the following : On the third day , God formed the land out of the seas . There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas . Some time after the land was formed , God created the plants : Then God said , `` Let the earth sprout vegetation , plants yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with seed in them , on the earth &apos;&apos; ; and it was so . ( Genesis 1:11 ) And the earth brought forth vegetation , plants yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with seed in them , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good . ( Genesis 1:12 ) The text clearly states that the earth `` sprouted &apos;&apos; the plants ( the Hebrew word deshe , Strong &apos;s # H 1877 , usually refers to grasses ) . The Hebrew word dasha , ( Strong &apos;s # H 1876 ) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have `` sprouted . &apos;&apos; In addition , these plants produced seeds . The Hebrew word here is zera ( Strong &apos;s # H 2233 ) , which is most often translated `` descendants . &apos;&apos; This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation . Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity , but produce seed or descendants . There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time . Things actually get worse for this interpretation . Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit . The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years , at minimum . God did not create the trees already bearing fruit . The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means . Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours , the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time . http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis.html",,Control_52,I would like to take the opportunity to advise you that she would certainly be an outstanding selection for that position .,Formal,411252,A reasonable point well made but I must still point out that you are attributing the evolutionary process with a sense of awareness and purpose .

Currently , most of those driving hybrids and such now , tend to be anal - retentive snobs who see their purchase as much as a status symbol as it is practical in saving on gas . Akin to the techies who have to have the latest , updated gadgets ... for me , the guine - pigs of the world who end up wasting their money on betamax &apos;s . I also am concerned over the power drain a LOT of these types of cars will hve on the power grid when they end up more mass - marketed . Sorry , some large population areas are barely supported by the current power grids as it is . Couple that in with weather and other related power outages can lead to a massive freeze as the cars people need to travel about in , have no source of power to recharge off of over night . In my area ( north KY , southern IN ) we had residual hurricane winds that knocked most everyone off of electricity back in Sept. . While such freak weather conditions are rare , it is possible that global warming will increase it . In my area , power outages due to XXXXXX knocking over power polls are not uncommon meaning a night or so without electricity . Often , some people hook up a GAS powered generator to run their lights . fridge and such during these events . While I do n&apos;t think a bunch of gas powered generators used to power up residential cars and homes will negate the enviornmental savings of electric vehicles , I do think they will pose more fire , theft and carbon monoxide poisoning risks ( I cover CO related problems a lot in the news ) . I do see a possible boom for those who invest in generator making companies . And , as such , gas stations selling gas will be needed for a while to come . So , weening ourselves off of petrolium will be a long time in coming . I &apos; m also concerned over the long term environmental poisoning the manufacture of electric batteries will have . Is it worse than gas refineries or the manufacture of current cars ? I know a lot of people have the new LED light bulbs that contain a bit o &apos; mercury .

The research is to understand , who becomes a Creationist , why , where your from etc . . Your help is most appreciated . Please give basic background : Age , State of residence , Marital status , Education Level , Religious Affiliation , Occupation . What type of Creationist are you ? Examples : Flat Earthers - believe that the earth is flat and is covered by a solid dome or firmament . Waters above the firmament were the source of Noah &apos;s flood . This belief is based on a literal reading of the Bible , such as references to the `` four corners of the earth &apos;&apos; and the `` circle of the earth . &apos;&apos; Few people hold this extreme view , but some do . Geocentrism - accept a spherical earth but deny that the sun is the center of the solar system or that the earth moves . As with flat - earth views , the water of Noah &apos;s flood came from above a solid firmament . The basis for their belief is a literal reading of the Bible . `` It is not an interpretation at all , it is what the words say . &apos;&apos; ( Willis 2000 ) Both flat - earthers and geocentrists reflect the cosmological views of ancient Hebrews . Geocentrism is not common today , but one geocentrist ( Tom Willis ) was intrumental in revising the Kansas elementary school curriculum to remove references to evolution , earth history , and science methodology . Young Earth Creationists - claim a literal interpretation of the Bible as a basis for their beliefs . They believe that the earth is 6000 to 10,000 years old , that all life was created in six literal days , that death and decay came as a result of Adam &amp; Eve &apos;s Fall , and that geology must be interpreted in terms of Noah &apos;s Flood . However , they accept a spherical earth and heliocentric solar system . Old - Earth Creationists - accept the evidence for an ancient earth but still believe that life was specially created by God , and they still base their beliefs on the Bible . There are a few different ways of accomodating their religion with science . Day - age creationists - interpret each day of creation as a long period of time , even thousands or millions of years . They see a parallel between the order of events presented in Genesis 1 and the order accepted by mainstream science . Day - Age Creationism was more popular than Gap Creationism in the 19th and and early 20th centuries . Evolutionary Creationism - differs from Theistic Evolution only in its theology , not in its science . It says that God operates not in the gaps , but that nature has no existence independent of His will . It allows interpretations consistent with both a literal Genesis and objective science , allowing , for example , that the events of creation occurred , but not in time as we know it , and that Adam was not the first biological human but the first spiritually aware one . Theistic Evolution - says that God creates through evolution . Theistic Evolutionists vary in beliefs about how much God intervenes in the process . It accepts most or all of modern science , but it invokes God for some things outside the realm of science , such as the creation of the human soul . This position is promoted by the Pope and taught at mainline Protestant seminaries . Materialistic Evolution - differs from Theistic Evolution in saying that God does not actively interfere with evolution . It is not necessarily atheistic , though ; many Materialistic Evolutionists believe that God created evolution , for example . Materialistic evolution may be divided into methodological and philosophical materialism . Methodological materialism limits itself to describing the natural world with natural causes ; it says nothing at all about the supernatural , neither affirming nor denying its existence or its role in life . Philosophical materialism - says that the supernatural does not exist . It says that not only is evolution a natural process , but so is everything else . Vedic Creationism Hinduism speaks of a very ancient earth . One book influenced by Hindu belief argues that anatomically modern humans have existed for billions of years .

Well , gee , that &apos;s quite impressive :) That &apos;s because the DH came into being in the 1890s . What possible point could you be trying to make here ? As I mentioned earlier , doubts about Moses &apos; authorship of the Torah extend back hundreds of years , based upon the content of the Torah . It took Wellhausen &amp; Co.

Since many of those same liberals are atheists , agnostics or , at the very least , strongly opposed to traditional religious values , we must ask : What is the basis of secular liberal morality ? A belief in morals infers a belief in right and wrong . Deciding whether something is right or wrong means that there must be some kind of moral standard and a corresponding judgment as to whether a particular behavior complies with that standard . If an act is consistent with that particular standard , it is moral behavior . If it deviates from that standard , it is immoral . For most Americans , the source of morality is easy to identify - it comes from religion . When Christians , for example , are confronted with a question regarding morality , The Bible gives them a standard by which they can make decisions . What , then , is the moral standard for liberals who discard Christian and other religious guidance ? If a liberal is thinking of committing , say , adultery or murder , what moral standard tells them it is wrong to do so ? The dirty little secret of secular liberals is that they do n&apos;t have a moral standard . No identifiable source affirmatively tells them what conduct is moral . Put quite simply , liberals do n&apos;t believe in anything . If liberals do n&apos;t believe in anything , you may ask , what is the basis of their politics ? That &apos;s easy . While liberals do n&apos;t believe in anything , they do believe against things . In other words , liberals have no independent moral philosophy - they merely look to traditional American or Christian views and oppose them . Most liberals argue that without universal health care , the `` rich &apos;&apos; are able to afford good health insurance , while the `` poor &apos;&apos; are not . Assuming , for the sake of argument , that the poor ca n&apos;t afford health insurance , why do liberals think this is wrong ? Liberals say : `` Because it is n&apos;t fair . &apos;&apos; Why not ? Saying that something is n&apos;t fair implies that there &apos;s a standard by which fairness can be judged . However , without a source of moral guidelines , how can liberals say that anything is unfair ? They ca n&apos;t . Another popular liberal argument is that we have to be compassionate toward those without proper health care . After all , we ca n&apos;t have people dying in the streets , can we ? Why not ? What moral standard tells liberals that they have to be compassionate or help their fellow man ? There is none . The lack of any affirmative morality is the Achilles &apos; heel of liberalism . It exposes the intellectual bankruptcy of the left and the logical inability of liberals to make any moral arguments regarding health care , or any other issue . God help them . The myth of liberal morality With the embrace of moral relativism and situational ethic the left lost its moral compass .

The study , reported in an edition of the journal Science , does little to settle the issue of whether there is a gene on the X chromosome that predisposes men to homosexuality . Men inherit their single X chromosome from their mothers . The gene was first predicted in 1993 based on studies of families with two gay brothers . `` The initial finding has n&apos;t been disproven , but it probably has n&apos;t been replicated to most people &apos;s satisfaction , &apos;&apos; said Alan Sanders , a psychiatrist and geneticist at the University of Chicago . `` Maybe it will be , and maybe it wo n&apos;t be . &apos;&apos; Dean Hamer , the scientist who first reported the connection , criticized the new study for not using families where homosexuality predominated on the mother &apos;s side . The researchers , argued Hamer , of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md. , were making it harder on themselves to find the gene . Several studies have supported the idea that genetics plays a role in homosexuality . But scientists say genetics can not be the whole story . For example , some gay men have an identical twin who is gay , and other gay men have an identical twin who is not gay . The term `` gay gene &apos;&apos; is misleading , scientists say , because there are likely to be many subtle genetic influences on sexual orientation . In the 1993 research , Hamer and his colleagues studied the genetic makeup of 40 families . As the researchers reported then in Science , genetic features on a region of the X chromosome tended to correlate with homosexual orientation . A 1995 study by the same researchers also suggested the link . An actual predisposing gene in the region has not been reported . The result was intriguing to many people . Some thought the study supported the notion that homosexuality is not a choice . But many scientists were cautious about saying Hamer &apos;s findings meant the `` gay gene &apos;&apos; really existed . While geneticists are adept at finding genes that cause clear - cut conditions , such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis , it has been much harder to pin down genes that underlie more complex traits . For instance , scientists know that certain disorders , such as schizophrenia and manic depression , have a genetic component . But they have not been able to pin down the culprit genes . That &apos;s probably because many genes , as well as other influences , contribute to the disorders . Scientists do n&apos;t put much stock in any one study unless other studies find the same result . `` The replication of a genetic finding in these behavioral ( traits ) is very difficult , &apos;&apos; said Melvin McInnis , a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore . Sexual orientation is likely to be just as complicated , he said . The result of the new study - by George Rice , George Ebers and Carol Anderson at the University of Western Ontario and Neil Risch at Stanford Medical School in California - does n&apos;t mean the first study was incorrect . Although the new study examined the same spot on the X chromosome in 104 gay men , it was done on different people . It could be , McInnis said , that an X chromosome gene is at work in the first group of people but not the second . Sanders has also tried to replicate the findings of Hamer , although his results have not appeared in a scientific journal . He said his study was more in the middle - it did n&apos;t replicate Hamer &apos;s findings , but it did n&apos;t exclude the possibility as strongly as the new study did . The only way to solve the problem is to study more people , the scientists said . Even then , if there is an effect of a gene on the X chromosome , scientists may never be able to pinpoint it if the effect is very small , Sanders said . http://www.gaytostraight.org/downloads/chapter2.pdf",,40200,"Exactly !

As of today , the law of our nation will acknowledge the plain fact that crimes of violence against a pregnant woman often have two victims , &apos;&apos; Bush said before the signing of the measure . `` The death of an innocent unborn child has too often been treated as a detail in one crime but not a crime in itself , &apos;&apos; the president said . The Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( search ) makes it a crime to harm a fetus during an assault on a pregnant woman . Bush signed the bill , which took five years to get through Congress , in an elaborate Rose Garden ceremony . Raw Data : Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( FindLaw ) The controversial measure , which gained new support following the 2002 murder of a pregnant Laci Peterson ( search ) , is also called `` Laci and Conner &apos;s law . &apos;&apos; The California woman was eight months pregnant with a son who was to be named Conner when she disappeared on Christmas Eve . Laci Peterson &apos;s husband , Scott Peterson ( search ) , has been charged with murder . California is one of 29 states with fetus protection laws . `` All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law can not look away and pretend there was just one , &apos;&apos; Bush said . Standing behind Bush in the East Room of the White House were a number of prominent lawmakers and people whose pregnant daughters had been slain . Bush focused on one family in particular : that of Laci Peterson . `` All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law can not look away and pretend there is just one , &apos;&apos; Bush said . `` They have laid to rest their daughter , Laci , a beautiful young woman who was joyfully awaiting the arrival of a new son ... This little soul never saw light but he is loved and he is remembered and his name is forever enjoined with that of his mother . &apos;&apos; The bill only applies during commission of federal crimes , such as a terrorist attack or drug - related shooting , and only when it is being committed against the pregnant mother . The bill defines an `` unborn child &apos;&apos; as a child in utero , which means `` a member of the species homo sapiens , at any stage of development , who is carried in the womb . &apos;&apos; That definition angers abortion rights supporters , who say the legislation defines life as starting at the point of conception and therefore confers person - status to the fetus . They add that the law will threaten a woman &apos;s right to choose . `` The bill President Bush has signed into law today is yet another example of the misleading tactics that opponents of a woman &apos;s right to choose are willing to employ , &apos;&apos; Vicki Saporta , president of the National Abortion Federation ( search ) , said in a statement . `` The bill &apos;s supporters claim they are trying to protect women from violence , yet they refused to allow any real violence prevention measures , or even aid to victims , into the bill . &apos;&apos; The bill specifically states that legal abortions are not a crime , but critics fear the way it defines life could provide a legal precedent for those who would outlaw the procedure . The Senate narrowly rejected an amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif . , that would have imposed the same penalties on assailants without referring to the legal status of a fetus . `` This law rights a blatant and indefensible wrong by establishing what everyone already knows - that these children were here , &apos;&apos; House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( search ) , R - Texas , said in a statement . `` With the president &apos;s signature , common sense and common decency are finally placed into law . &apos;&apos; Abortion opponents welcome the law as a step toward more protections for the unborn . Bush said he supported the legislation though he did not think the country was headed toward banning abortions . Bush has said he opposes abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when pregnancy endangers a woman &apos;s life . That position has become a standard line in most of his speeches . `` We stand for a culture of life",

If you &apos; ll note from the site linked to , the minsiter of UBM comments on the bible , using verse . In the ` by his stripes you are healed &apos; verse , he shows his biblical ignorance . Confusing the forgiveness of sin with the curing of illnesses . This is very common in most contemporary evangelicalistic religions like WofF who &apos;s pastors often rely on ` personal revelations &apos; on what the bible means rather than actually learning what it means . Jesus used healing to show he was the messiah . His death on the cross was to heal sin . Biblically ignorant people still confuse sin as causing illness . Often , they &apos; ll try to push off a pseudo - knowledge of the original languages by straight - translating the Greek or Hebrew to English . Ommitting grammar and context . This is how you get the ` God Kind of Faith &apos; that the whole WofF theology is based on . Mistranslating ` Have faith in God &apos; to mean ` Have faith of God &apos; ... have the God Kinda Faith . In their revelations , they believe god used ` faith powers &apos; to create everything and do everything . The links comments on ` Jesus perfect faith &apos; reflects this . If one only has ` the faith of a mustard seed &apos; they can do all things . So , if you want something , have faith that it HAS happened . Do n&apos;t let doubt into your life . After all , ` faith pleases the lord &apos; and the opposite , doubt , must be displeasing . Logical , no ? Thus , taking your child ( or yourself ) to the doctors is permissable ... if you simply admit that you do n&apos;t have faith in God ... and His miracles . The pastors ( and I &apos; ve heard MANY in person ) do state , as a caveat , that ` if you need the doctor , then by all means , go ! But , if you have the faith like I do , then you &apos; ll have perfect health . Why , I &apos; ve been attacked by the devil several times who &apos;s visited symptoms on me , but , I just `` confess my faith &apos;&apos; and I &apos; m instantly cured . &apos; Such commentary by pastors and others is manipulative and implies that they are the visible models to live by , he IS a mand ob gawd after all . The levels of psychological manipulation put upon a congregation are unimaginable . You &apos; ll also note that in that link , the pastor dishonestly focuses on the biblical passages that have the person &apos;s faith healing them ( not Jesus/God ) . They often push this message and will violently oppose ( even twisting scripture ) that is is your faith that heals you ... not God . You command it , God has to do it ... that &apos;s how it works . it &apos;s part of your ` conenant deal &apos; . This would be basic heresy to any Christian who was worth his salt . And note , when they suffered a loss of a child , the pastor , in typical WofF fasion , places all the blame on their shoulders for not having enough faith . Or having ` unconfessed sin &apos; in some unknown area ... `` Sometimes we stumble because of lack of faith or repentance in an area but hopefully we correct this and get back up . &apos;&apos; It &apos;s never the fault of the false message they pushed . I wonder if their daughter will ` get back up &apos; . Maybe if they &apos; re tru WofFers like Hobart Freeman , they &apos; ll keep the body around a few months and pray for it &apos;s ressurrection ... cause , once , in band - camp , the pastor raised a pair of drowned twins who everyone else said were dead ... edit : oh snappity snap ! &apos;&apos; We are sure Kara does not want to come back but we have asked God to send her for her parents &apos; sake and as a testimony of His love for us . &apos;&apos; The DO want Kara to be physically ressurrected .

Conservatives think differently . An impass . Many just ca n&apos;t grasp the notion ... even if it &apos;s heavily laden in verbage used that both sides view the ` fetus &apos; differently . IMO , most arguements between the 2 camps get no where . As to Duo Maxwell and others ^ , ever been behind bars ? Even in America ?

Prison is full of people who often think they &apos; re getting a fairly decent deal . Only thing is trying to figure out what to do with your time to entertain yourself . Conservatives want to ` punish &apos; people who do wrong . Liberals often want to rehabilitate them or simply remove them peacefully from society so they can do no further harm . But , punishment can be too harsh and some can appear rehabilitarted or find a way to get back into society to cause more harm . I personally think we should sent them to a near inescapable penal colony . Yeah , some place inhospitableish . We can call it Australia . ;) Also , the economic proofs used to oppose the death penalty are about as weak as you can get . The simple matter of the disparity in the figures comes from the thoroughness used in most death penalty cases . More is placed on something believed to be permanent that they want to make sure they &apos; re doing it right .

Bean counting . It &apos;s the same thing . * Unless I &apos; m making the statement , then , of course , it &apos;s complety rational and good . Teehee , pretty large claim there however it &apos;s not a literal claim just like the bad hair day comment . VOC is n&apos;t a good debator since his points are meandering and generic . However , do consider there was a recent case where a woman refused a Cesarian in the US for rather selfish issues and caused the death of one of her twins she was carring . So , such extrapolation is n&apos;t too hard to believe . So , yes , in the realm of 40 millionish abortions in the US , it &apos;s not too hard to believe that a woman would have an abortion for such a silly reason . Hell , people murder citizens ( living grown people ) for less . ... Are YOU looking at me funny ? Blam . ... She stole my shampoo ! STAB . ... I &apos; m too lazy and cheap to get a divorce ( quite a few murders ) . ... Want to get even with your wife ... kill the living baby . ... Ummm ... Idonno ... I just kilt em .

Yep , that chic I went to high school got an abortion because she got a ticket for running a red light . emoticon_rolleyes You know why you ca n&apos;t find much in the way of documented reasons on why people get an abortion ?

Something quite different than when you &apos; re pushed infront of some detectives and actually questioned over your motives for murdering someone . You &apos; re too cute .

At best WWII indirectly helped but those are circumstances you ca n&apos;t reproduce . Just to clarify , my argument is that their is little evidence to support the government spending does anything hurt us more when the spending stops and it is debatable it helps us while we are getting the money . During the New Deal unemployment was ridiculously high ... even at the end of it ( 15 % ) . That `` again &apos;&apos; is WWII and when it stopped what happened ? The economy slumped again . As Daewoo and I have been discussing it may be that WWII indirectly helped with industry build up and combined with the fact that no one was producing anything helped us out . This is a rare set of circumstances that almost never exist ... and do n&apos;t today . A minor recession is still a recession and 2 years is not great . Furthermore , let &apos;s say the WWII spending did pull us out . Do you realize the spending that took place during that time and what that would cost us today ? Luckily taxes were sky high then and not too much debt was taken on but if that level of spending is needed to only make us have a minor recession after the spending ends than we are screwed . In any event , this is n&apos;t the case . We have had recessions where we did n&apos;t spend much more money ( 1990 ) and we did fine . We have had some where we lowered taxes and that did the same thing as doing nothing as well . There is no correlation between government spending an improving an economy . This is a correlation between massive amounts of debt/printed money and hyper inflation though . It was n&apos;t that much ( we were paid back for some if it too ) and is still irrelevant to your point . You are arguing now that we should always do government spending and this is n&apos;t what Keynes said . I &apos; d prefer to stay on topic . What happens if you print money so that everyone had a billion dollars . Will this increase demand or make the dollar worthless ? See above for why WWII created a demand ... it was n&apos;t government spending directly . we &apos; ve had two stimulus packages so far and they did n&apos;t work . Japan did 10 or so in the 90s and none of them did n&apos;t work . The excuse is always `` it was never enough &apos;&apos; but apparently the only thing that is enough might be flattening half the world and depriving the other half of anything tangible for 5 years while building massive amounts of factories .

As long as you stick to the facts ( war is where people kill other people , some use it as a means for solving disputes , etc ) and state opinions as such ( some believe we should never go to war no matter what and others think war is fine as a means of solving a dispute ) then I think they should be presented with both .

Lest I get up off my lazy XXX , and grab that book and type it out for us . Anyway ... I know that time stops at light speed . And one of the neat little threads I often put up in Science Forums is how you can travel 100,000 light years instantaneously . Actually , you can be at ANY point in the universe SIMULTANEOUSLY , and instantly , when you are travelling at light speed . But , I &apos; m just avoiding answering the question ... When does time stop . OK . My understanding of time is that it exists in any `` system &apos;&apos; in which the most elementry particles of matter are in motion . What I also recall is that the condition necessary For Time To Stop ... is an infinitely large ( inward ) gravitational force towards a single point , such as inside a Black Hole . What I recall about When Time Stops ... is when all matter is at complete rest ... i.e. no electrons are weaving around , nothing in or outside that matter is in motion , nor vibrating ... ( the in motion part I &apos; m not sure of ... if it includes in motion relative to all other matter in the universe , or in motion relative to the `` system &apos;&apos; being considered . My guess is the latter for a limited `` system &apos;&apos; , but the former , if speaking of the time for the entire universe . ) So it is my understanding that if the system you are referring to is just a specific Black Hole , then inside that Black Hole , Time has stopped ... However , if we are speaking of the entire Universe , as the `` system &apos;&apos; under consideration for when time stops ... Then we are talking about when all the matter in the Universe has gathered together into a single `` mass &apos;&apos; , so that no matter exists outside of it , and again , there is a Big Black hole ... But . . my understanding is that there is at least one theory that believes it is possible that when all of the matter in the Universe collapses ( if it ever does collapse again ) , that it may undergo a phase transition into pure energy , as I understand it , it &apos;s would be like some kind of light , and energy plasma with a huge amount of heat , and then that stuff transitions again into matter , explodes in the Big One , and POOF , Time Starts again .

The dishonesty which you represent is reflected in every aspect of your personal world view , so I &apos; m not surprised that that same dishonesty is projected through all of the anti - christian propaganda you spew . Here are some undeniable facts regarding his pro - socialist beliefs . Odinga Made A Deal with Kenyan Muslims to Institute Islamic Law ; Obama Campaigned for Him [ Update : As a reader pointed out , Sharia is an assault on women . ] The video below tells a shocking story of Barack Obama &apos;s involvement , while a US Senator , in the Presidential campaign of Raila Odinga . Now that Obama has acknowledged having had Kenyan citizenship , it &apos;s time to take another serious look at his recent campaign activities on behalf of Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga , a Muslim sympathizer and leader of the socialist Orange Democratic Movement . We review the Obama - Odinga campaign collaboration with this central question in mind : As a former Kenyan citizen , does Obama &apos;s open involvement in Kenyan presidential politics raise troubling questions about his loyalties ? Apparently Obama traveled to Kenya on official business as a US Senator ; the trip was funded by US taxpayers . Odinga &apos;s policy positions were against stated US interests . Odinga , running on the slogan `` Agent of Change , &apos;&apos; lost the race for President of Kenya in December 2007 and thereafter led a campaign of widespread ethnic warfare in protest of his loss . In August 2007 , Odinga had signed an agreement with Islamic extremists to institute Islamic Law should he be elected President of Kenya , and he vowed to end cooperation with the United States in the war against terror . WHY did OBAMA actively campaign for him ? The TD Blog initiated a review of the Constitutional problems related to Barack Obama &apos;s dual citizenship . His activities in Kenya illustrate how dual citizenship can create divided loyalties and thus disqualify a candidate for Commander - in-Chief of the United States . [ Incidentally , this is also a clear - cut violation of the Logan Act -- see our article in the Reference List at the end . ] This central question is now being litigated by Philip J. Berg . Whether or not Berg &apos;s case prevails on the procedural issues of standing and jurisdiction - the issue of dual citizenship must eventually be reviewed by the federal courts . In the event that Obama gets elected , I predict that this legal problem will ultimately end his presidency . What a shame that he &apos;s been so secretive and deceptive about his past . By the way , in case you are unfamiliar with our work , led by in - house researcher and scholar `` Judah Benjamin , &apos;&apos; we maintain that Obama &apos;s Indonesian citizenship could still be active . Why Did Obama Campaign for a Pro - Islam Candidate in Kenya ? [ UPDATE ] td blog YouTube - Barack Obama in Kenya supporting Raila Odinga and Violence Watch the video . It &apos;s 8 minutes long . The first 6 minutes give an excellent overview of Odinga &apos;s bid for President and his socialist background . Obama &apos;s role in Odinga &apos;s candidacy begins at approximately 6:20 . It is truly stunning and something that every American voter MUST SEE : Now , I realize I &apos; m wasting my time even attempting to reason with the likes of you foundit , but let me ask you a question in order to send this message home . If I was running for a public office and asked you to campaign for me in the gay community , would you do it for me since we agree on absolutely nothing regarding your definition of what gay rights are compared to my definition ? Of course you would n&apos;t do anything to help me , whom you believe to be a philosophical enemy , to gain a public office which I could use to work against your interests . Yet you wo n&apos;t apply the same rationale to Obama as he endorses and campaigns for his socialist and pro islamic cousin . Why would Obama ever campaign for Odinga unless he agreed with what he represented ? The answer is , like you , he would n&apos;t .

With regards love , which is something you do , that is independent of evolution , and which is it that &apos;s directly from evolution ?

No , it leads to evolutionists thinking that all things come from evolution , love , business , philosophy , even religion . Like you attempting earlier , in very vague terms , about love .

It &apos;s in your re - construction of what I believe - that I believe in God , and you ca n&apos;t because you do n&apos;t accept any evidences except materialistic ones which ca n&apos;t prove God .

A slug does n&apos;t have the brains we do , yet survives . Everything survives because of evolution is what you &apos; re saying ... whether it has higher thinking , or not . Everything just is , because of evolution ! Higher thinking , lower thinking , no thinking , all enable survival , because they all survive . Why is it that we have ` free will &apos; and not some insect - like communal system where - by the individual is under the will of the general good ?

I agree with it as a concept and I agree how it was applied in Roe v. Wade . Yes , and they can if they provide a compelling reason to . This is very petty of you to do , but so be it . However , Congress has much more power to harm you than the Supreme Court does . Currently your objection is their ability to protect rights . This means nothing . And whether they are liberal or conservative should not matter , I agree . I think basing decisions on political ideology is wrong . You mean Congress is at fault for the Supreme Court being this way ? ! And yet , you trust Congress more ? Since they can be `` unelected &apos;&apos; why do they do this ? For me , it would make me trust them less . Ok . If it did it would have said it only applied to slavery . They had one that said `` slavery is hereby abolished &apos;&apos; or some such . `` like how did we did during slavery &apos;&apos; . Ok , I can live with that . It does n&apos;t apply to only slavery . Yes ! It is straight forward in that it was meant to protect rights from arbitrarily taken away ( and not just in slavery ) . It does not mention anything it specifically applies to because it was meant to apply to anything that is in that situation . It &apos;s purpose was to protect rights . It may have been created in response to the slavery issue , but it is meant to protect rights . Joking or not , I believe this . Agreed . They can create precedents and make decisions on the law . They can decide that no case warrants the death penalty . Since they are the final word on matters of law ( `` judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court ... &apos;&apos; ) it is a perfectly valid power . Ok . This is outside the scope of our debate however . They do this . They look at the law and decide how to apply it . You disagree on how they did this and I agree with how they did this . The Constitution does not explicitly state how they are supposed to employ their power , so they are technically free to do so . That is a different issue than substantive due process . Ok . No , but we have to trust them to rule on matters of law . We do n&apos;t decide the powers of the branches , they have their power already . The judicial branch has no exceeded its power because its power was not defined in the Constitution . They interpret the law and apply it to situations . When you say `` does n&apos;t mean you can interpret the law to mean whatever &apos;&apos; you mean you do n&apos;t want them to interpret it in a way you disagree with . I do not know , I would have to know their rationale . Even then I might disagree with them . Ok . They change as society changes . There is no criteria but what the judges believe it should mean . `` Cruel and unusual &apos;&apos; would change as society changes ... who determines what is cruel and unusual ? Judges . Congress does as well when it makes laws to prohibit certain things based upon it as well . In this way judges power can only help and protect us . Because methods that can possibly be cruel change over time . No , it means that any meaning must be based upon this . If a Supreme Court judge makes an unpopular decision ( no matter if you agree they should have the power or not ) we have to live with that decision until it is overturned by later courts ( if it was indeed as heinous as you think it is ) . I &apos; m skipping a bit that was redundant . And they do look at the law and apply it . They do , however , have to decide what the law means in terms of that case . That &apos;s where their `` feelings &apos;&apos; come in , what they feel it is supposed to mean .

It ca n&apos;t be proven that many things are harmless , for example . It ca n&apos;t be proven that opposite - sex marriage is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that alcohol use is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that airbags or seatbelts are harmless , even . There might be some unforseen harm in same - sex marriage , but if that harm can not be listed or spoken of , then we have no right banning same - sex marriage . Disallowing something based on the opinion that there is probably some harm , without actually listing that harm , is not an action of a free government , it is the action of a tyrannical government . This implies that the government has the right to ban things even if there is no speakable reason for banning them . What I mean is , I can argue that same - sex marriage brings no harm . In fact , I will state that right now . But such an argument is hard to make if no possible harms of same - sex marriage are listed . Without a list of possible harms of same - sex marriage , I &apos; d have to go through an infinite list of harms and prove why each one does not apply to same - sex marriage . I &apos; d have to assume that same - sex marriage causes every possible harm then prove that harm wrong .

In light of this , I would like you to list some possible harms of same - sex marriage so that this harm can be debated . Furthermore , even if same - sex marriage were not harmless ( which I still claim that it is ) , that would not be enough reason to ban the activity . That harm would have to be weighed up against the many benefits of same - sex marriage to determine whether the harm outweighs the benefits or not . These benefits include : - Freedom of people to marry who they choose - Greater equality under the law - Better homes for children in adoption facilities - Eased financial burden on same - sex couples - Encouragement of family unit which provides emotional and financial support in times where one member is in need - Setting a precendent of preventing government from interfering in the personal lives of citizens - Expanding health care coverage partners of same - sex couples and their children If any harms of same - sex marriage could not overcome those benefits ( and any others that might be brought up ) , then same - sex marriage should be legalized , even if it could not be said to be harmless .",,256604,It is called heterosexual privledge .,,169433,"Diogenes99 , you are quoting my words but assigning them to Platypus :) Some of the things you are replying to belong to Platypus .

The situation would include the person or persons involved and their own opinions . It would involve the opinions of the society and culture so this means that our own history and future becomes a part of the decision making process . God would look at all of that and gather information from the things that are really making the decision and those are components involved in the situation such as the feelings and opinions of humans , animals , aliens , ghosts , and whatever else there is . Then he would have to determine how an event will play out over time and how it will affect all the opinions and feelings of those in the future and the angels in heaven who are of course going to be affected based on how it affects those they left behind .

Rights which we as citizens hold , which are n&apos;t explicitly named . And as the last sentence demonstrates , the `` other rights &apos;&apos; ARE INCLUDED in the 9th amendment . This all goes to my argument . My argument that the 9th amendment talks about `` other rights &apos;&apos; which are n&apos;t included in the constitution . NATURAL rights which we as a people KNOW in our hearts are rights , and do n&apos;t need to explicitly list them in a constitution to acknowledge their existence . Now , I ALSO quoted the follow - on sentence , which establishes the TONE of that section . It ( along with the context of the previous sentence ) , IS NOT denying the existence of the `` natural rights &apos;&apos; which I have explicitly said the 9th amendment talks about . The follow - on statement talks about the founders &apos; view being BROADER than just natural rights . Ergo , not EXCLUDING the points I am talking about , but INCLUDING MORE than that . And as an additional note , in reading this we MUST NOT blindly assume that the `` perspective &apos;&apos; they talked about and the opinions on the 9th amendment ARE AUTOMATICALLY WHAT WAS SEEN ON THE FINAL DRAFT . These are perspectives and compromises that were discussed in the fight to WRITING the 9th amendment . These `` perspectives &apos;&apos; are part of the reasons why SOME people thought the 9th amendment was important , but it IS NOT significant to the ACTUAL FINAL VERSION of the 9th amendment . Continuing on ... Note the word HISTORICAL 9th amendment here . The author frequently adds in adjectives and qualifiers to his discussion of the 9th amendment . He talks about the DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ( not just Madison ) which went into the 9th amendment . The HISTORY of the different views on the 9th amendment . Now , keeping the last quoted section in mind , let &apos;s compare Madison &apos;s ORIGINAL 9th amendment to the FINAL version which was actually signed ... Notice the GLARING difference here ... The ACTUALLY ratified 9th amendment version DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY MENTION of `` powers &apos;&apos; of the government . It focuses SOLELY and EXCLUSIVELY on an issue that is mentioned earlier in the article . NATURAL RIGHTS . In Madison &apos;s version , the amendment discusses the `` powers &apos;&apos; of the government , in addition to the subject of the rights . In the FINAL VERSION , the focus is JUST on the RIGHTS . This , in and of itself , should demonstrate that the focus of Madison &apos;s version is significantly different from the focus of the FINAL version , which our founding fathers actually signed . So , while Madison wanted the 9th amendment to include MORE than it actually does ... Despite the fact that many wanted the 9th amendment to include statements on governmental `` powers &apos;&apos; ... Despite the history of the push and pull that went into the making of the FINAL DRAFT of the 9th amendment ... What REALLY matters is what the 9th amendment ACTUALLY SAYS . Moving a bit further ... You &apos; ll notice something SERIOUSLY out of date here . An interpretation of the 9th and 10th amendment as giving the states a PASS at having to recognize the rights established by the constitution . That the rights of the constitution are something for the STATE to legislate and not the federal government . It &apos;s out - dated because of the 14th amendment which clearly establishes that the rights of the constitution which require the federal government to protect them ALSO include application of protection with the state government .

For example , if you asked `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester even if the woman was struggling in college &apos;&apos; then you &apos; d probably get 60 % of people to say they would allow it .

The causes for the formation of these pairs of layers is understood . Summer melting and runoff and/or algae bloom is responsible for the dark , coarse layer where deposition is rapid . The finer , lighter layer is caused by the slow deposition of the settling of fine silt suspended in the water . There are lakes all over the world that exhibit this pattern of annual varves from many years in the past . They are still being deposited today . In the highlands of Central America there is such a lake . Cores from the lake bottom show in excess of 12,000 varves ( 24,000 strata ) . This observation alone would be enough to cast doubt on the idea of a global flood about 4,500 years ago . There is no indication of an interuption in this annual pattern and it continues to this day . However , there is one anomaly in the varves of this lake . About 11,000 years ago there is a layer of soot in one of the varves and all of the summer layers above that soot contain corn ( maize ) pollen . Corn does not grow wild . It requires cultivation by humans . If humans stopped planting corn , it would become extinct in a single year . The hypothesis is that humans burned off the vegitation to create fields to plant crops . Corn made up at least part of those crops . Creationists claim that a varve count is incorrect because sometimes more than one varve is laid down in a single year ( it has never actually been observed ) . However , in the case of this lake , the varves show a crop cycle , planted once each year . By the way , the varves in core samples of Lake Suigetsu in Japan have been counted up to a count of about 45,000 . These varves were then radiocarbon dated . The dates of the first 9,000 varves confirmed the previous calibration of radiocarbon dating methods derived from dendrochronology . Those below 9,000 have established a calibration for radiocarbon dating past that age . This supplies calibration for what is essentially the complete useful time period of radiocarbon dating .",,138481,I want a Conservative judge that is a strict constructionist and that interprets the Constitution and with the 3 judges that is exactly what i got ... ...

And it came against a priest with a particularly high profile : the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado , 86 , the founder of the Legionaries of Christ , one of the fastest growing Catholic communities , praised often by Pope John Paul II . The statement said that Father Maciel would not undergo a church trial for the allegations against him , which were not disclosed , though at least nine men had accused him of molestation . The reasons , the statement said , were Father Maciel &apos;s `` advanced age &apos;&apos; and `` weak health . &apos;&apos; But the statement said the Vatican &apos;s doctrinal office had decided `` to invite the father to a life reserved to prayer and penitence , renouncing any public ministry . The Holy Father has approved these decisions . &apos;&apos; Reactions to the Vatican decision varied , with some praising the Pope for taking so public a stand and other saying it did not go far enough , given the seriousness of the allegations against Father Maciel himself and the wider crisis of confidence in the church over sexual abuse . `` It certainly could be stronger , &apos;&apos; said John Wilkins , the former editor of the influential British Catholic magazine , the Tablet . `` But this is the founder of the Legionaries , &apos;&apos; he said . `` This is a pretty devastating judgment for the Legionaries . For a new movement like that , the reputation and position of the founder is critical . &apos;&apos; The judgment was first made public on Thursday on the website of National Catholic Reporter . The Vatican document did not specify exactly what duties Father Maciel would be barred from , but National Catholic reporter quoted anonymous Vatican officials as saying he could not celebrate mass publicly , give speeches or interviews . The Legionaries was founded by Father Maciel in Mexico in 1941 and has now grown to include about 650 priests worldwide and 2,500 seminarians in 20 countries . The order runs a dozen universities , and recently opened its first degree - granting college in the United States , the University of Sacramento . Father Maciel stepped down from the order &apos;s leadership this year . Pope John Paul II had repeatedly praised him and his work , most recently at a public audience last Nov. 30 , for the 60th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood . In 1994 , in a trip to Mexico , Pope John Paul II called him `` an efficacious guide to youth &apos;&apos; -- a statement that several victims said prompted them to make complaints .",

That is false . By the 1860s , the South was paying the overwhelming majority of federal revenues . There was no income tax and the primary source of government revenues was from duties on European imports that disproportionately fell on Southerners , the vast majority of whom did not even own slaves at all . The revenue raised by Southern trade with Europe was being fleeced from the South and sent North through the House of Representatives to finance the industrialization of the North . The North sought to subsidize its inefficient manafacturing industry at the expense of the South and to divert trade with the Western states away from a low tarriff Southern Confederacy . Economics , not slavery was the cause of the War Between the States . Most American Wars have been economically motivated as well . Yes it is true the South was exporting products abroad and buying cheaper European manafactured goods . The manafacturing base of the North was PROTECTED by high tarriffs imposed on European imports . Northern industry was being coddled by the Federal Government , at the EXPENSE of the South . LOL the South oppossed high tarriffs on European goods and the fact that it was the South that was paying BY FAR the majority of revenues to the Federal Government , which were appropriated through the House of Representatives for infrastructure and industrialization products in the NORTH . The North was enriching itself at the expense of the South and sought to use the tarriff issue to divert Western trade to Northern ports , at the expense of the South . That is precisely what caused the War Between the States . This is a lie and is not true at all . The entire British Empire abolished slavery peacefully in just several years , as did Brazil without firing a single shot . Further , free labour is much more profitable by than slave labour and the Upper South was massively divesting itself from the slavery anyway , selling their slaves to the Gulf States . Capital Intensive agriculture was killing slavery in the United States just as it had in DOZENS of other nations throughout the world anyway . Do we need slave labour to pick cotton today ? emoticon_rolleyes This is on its face ridiculous . Slavery as an issue in the war did not even arise until well into the middle of the conflict . Lincoln himself said on NUMEROUS occassions that he had no intention whatsoever of interfering with the slavery institution of the Southern states . Lincoln proposed a Constitutional Amendment in 1861 that would have legalized slavery forever , as he cited in his own inaugural address . He DID state however that he was entirely unwilling to negotiate regarding tarriffs on imported European goods , the PROTECTIONISM that was the bread and butter of his own Northern financers . Lincoln was more than willing to work out a deal with the South regarding slavery . That is because they were much more expensive and the North was not buying the equivilant exports of the South , but was penalizing the South with a protective tarriff and fleecing the South of revenue . Yes , in order to increase the profits of Northern manafacturers and the politicians they bankrolled like Abraham Lincoln . Which remains true to this day , well after the abolition of slavery . emoticon_rolleyes Yes that is true . The South was bankrolling the federal government and a low tarriff South would have obliterated Northern trade and drawn the Western states into the orbit of the South . And in the North , which had been the case for decades and a source of bitter dispute . Yes it was out of financial self interest and had nothing whatsoever to do with moralistic rhetoric over slavery . Slavery was protected under the Constitution . This is not true at all . The South was afraid that the federal government would raise tarriffs to further enrich itself at the expense of the South , which was a legitimate concern . Lincoln was more than willing to accomodate the South with regards to slavery as I pointed out before . You mean a NORTHERN industrial economy requires PROTECTIONISM from competition to enrich itself at the expense of the South and of consumers . Quite naturally the South was opposed to Lincoln &apos;s plan to enrich his supporters at their expense . Yes the states created the Federal Government , it is quite ridiculous to suggest that the Federal Government is superior to its own antecedents , which delegated power to the Federal Government in the first place . No that is not a fact at all because States Rights continued to be a major factor in Southern politics for decades afterwards and remains the case to this very day . The Civil War was a contest between the North and the South over the desire of the North to create a strong centralized federal government , a dictatorship , at the economic and political expense of the South . The war was not fought for any moralistic reason in the least . It was fought on one side for independence and on the other side for the desire to financially exploit other populations , as was no doubt proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by the conduct of the North after the war . This is not true at all . The economic and political dispute between the North and the South , regarding first the growing importance of the West and bitterness of the North enriching itself at the expense of the South caused the war . Lincoln was more than willing to come to an agreement with the South with regards to slavery . His emancipation proclomation did not end slavery at all in the border states or the occupied states . Lincoln said himself that if he could save the Union and collect his tarriff he was more than willing to come to an agreement with regards to slavery . This is where you come in and say that it was slavery that was the source of revenue for the South , and where I disagree by pointing out to you that slavery was naturally coming to an end in the South anyway , as it did in Brazil , because of advancement in capital intensive agriculture , immigration , and the profitability of free labour .",,235520,Do you believe that you are an embodied soul or spirit that will have experience an afterlife after death here on earth ?

What I mean to say is , no objections you &apos; ve raised apply in this specific instance . First of all , your alleged ` universal principle &apos; does not apply . The creation of the nylonase enzyme is not in absolute terms advantageous to the organism : nylon waste products must be present in order for the enzyme &apos;s chemical properties to be a net gain for the organism &apos;s ability to survive and thrive . So you ca n&apos;t be referring to your ` axiom &apos; as a reason why the enzyme will not be produced . The other objections you &apos; ve raised in have concerned ` meaning &apos; . You &apos; ve asserted that novel traits require novel ` words &apos; to be added to the genetic language , words that would be meaningless if originated via RM . However , the nylonase gene does not require any novel ` words &apos; . Both it , and the gene it is a mutation of , are in the same symbolic language , whose vocabulary is the 64 possible nucleotide triplets ( 4x4x4 = 64 permutations ) which the organism decodes into the various amino acids . In your last post you &apos; ve tried to say that not all triplets are decoded into proteins , which indicates I &apos; m not the only one getting confused :) Let &apos;s recap : A triplet or ` codon &apos; is three adjacent nucleotides as read from a strand of DNA by the organism . There are four different nucleotides , and thus 4x4x4 = 64 possible codons . In the standard code used by most organisms , one of those codons ( AUG ) is used to mean ` start creating a protein &apos; and three others ( UAG , UGA , UAA ) are interpreted as ` stop &apos; . All the triplets the organism encounters in between are interpreted as instructions to creaute one of the possible amino acids , which it strings together into a protein . There are no meaningless or untranslatable codons . It &apos;s true that a lot of DNA is n&apos;t translated into proteins , but that &apos;s not for any mysterious reason . The bits that are n&apos;t , are n&apos;t start/stop terminated , so the developmental apparatus does n&apos;t translate them . Indeed , the disruption of a ` start &apos; codon is one way a gene can be ` turned off &apos; . Going back to the specific example of the nylonase gene , the frameshift mutation occurs after the ` start &apos; codon , and so does not prevent the organism from creating a protein . And because all possible codons have a pre - established meaning to the organism , the organism ca n&apos;t ` get stuck &apos; or ` not know what they mean &apos; . So if your axiom can not object , and no new semiotic meaning is required for the mutated gene to be translated into the nylonase enzyme , what exactly is your objection to RM - origination of the nylonase gene resulting in the production of the nylonase enzyme ? We can go through it step by step if you like , and you can stop me when we reach something you believe ` ca n&apos;t happen &apos; . 1 . A random mutation occurs ( say during cell division ) resulting in a frameshift within a preexisting protein - encoding gene . 2 . The inheriting organism reads the DNA and hits the ` start &apos; codon , which has not been affected by the mutation . 3 . The organism starts to construct a protein , translating each ` three letter word &apos; in the DNA into an amino acid according to the same language it uses to translate every other protein - encoding gene . Although the frameshift has radically altered the ` sentence &apos; ( eg TTTAAAGGG ... - &lt; UTTTAAAGGG ... ) no new codon ` words &apos; have been created : all 64 possible codons are already understood by the organism so it encounters no instructions it can not follow . 4 . The string of amino acids produced is what we call the nylonase enzyme . 5 . The enzyme chemically breaks down any nylon waste products that happen to be around , liberating the raw materials for the organism to metabolise . I &apos; ve scoured our recent correspondence again and again and I can not find anything you &apos; ve said that speaks to the impossibility of any of the above . If you believe otherwise , could you please explain , indicating which step in the above process can not happen , and why ?

Again , Democracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding on what is for dinner . The lamb &apos;s `` right to life &apos;&apos; being ignored by a democratic vote is hardly a real means of determining rights or freedom . Society is not consistent enough for such protections . Look at internment camps for Japanese Americans in WW II . Would that have been okay by standards of `` freedom &apos;&apos; just cause a majority at the time approved ? And in the years after , when the horrible abuse of rights was recognized , would that mean the `` freedom &apos;&apos; suddenly existed again ? While the crystal clarity of the courts may not be as solid as desirable , it is clearly more rigid and bound by more constraints than the arbitrary whim of society . I do n&apos;t see why you would try to distinguish it in this manner . I see an EXISTING procedure at work . We disagree on its validity . The courts evaluate a legitimate state interest and determine if the discrimination is constitutional . That IS a procedure . I personally thought Prop 8 should be rejected because it did n&apos;t use the proper constitutional change voting requirements . The change was obviously a modification to the FUNDAMENTAL nature of the California constitution , ergo it should have required more than a simple majority . With that said , I still hold to the procedure . If the California populace were to vote in Prop 8 with the appropriate majority , I would recognize the process has been honored . I would not agree with the outcome , but still recognize the validity of it . I sincerely believe by your procedural approach , we would still have states with miscegenation laws . The very nature of such an assessment completely eliminates the significance of the test . I ca n&apos;t think of any law that would be eliminated under such a standard , because every law has been voted into office . Either by the legislature or by the people . Every law passes under your interpretation . Recognizing that , if one adheres to the philosophy of a `` legitimate state interest &apos;&apos; , a simple will of the people can not provide sufficient rational . The courts have even stated this explicitly . emoticon_xgood Uh . No . YOUR explanation gives no idea what the term means . There does exist an application of the term , which contradicts your personal application . Actually , I would argue that `` hardly democratic &apos;&apos; is PART OF THE POINT . The test for legitimate state interest CAN NOT be satisfied by a `` democratic &apos;&apos; approach , otherwise no law would be invalidated . And as for what `` it should mean &apos;&apos; , there are a variety of legal rulings on the subject , including the different standards like strict scrutiny , intermediate scrutiny , rational basis . On another level , I ca n&apos;t help but refer back to the 14th amendment . The people who WROTE the 14th amendment could have EXPLICITLY WROTE what they wanted , but they did not . They kept it vague . They did n&apos;t even mention race in the section in question . The clause was obviously written with race in mind , but they NEVER SAID IT . To put that a different way , it was a conscious decision TO EXCLUDE any mention of what the 14th amendment was specifically designed to address . The obvious conclusion is that they meant for the 14th amendment to encompass MORE than just race . They wanted it to BE an issue that needed to be interpreted . And what I described would be entirely legal at the state level ... To be fair , that list is pretty well itemized . Inheritance . Taxes . Spousal consent . Spousal privilege . etc , etc . . It also includes DIVORCE requirements as a `` right / benefit &apos;&apos; . The legislation that prevents a man from saying ( and implementing ) `` get out of my house , we &apos; re divorced &apos;&apos; is part of those benefits . It would essentially come down to a `` he said / she said &apos;&apos; situation , leaving no legislation guidelines on how to address the situation . I would n&apos;t think that wise . For some aspects , such `` agreements &apos;&apos; would be possible . For other aspects , how can you force a hospital to give you visitation rights if the hospital says `` relatives only &apos;&apos; and you &apos; re just a friend ? There are some rights in that list of 1,000 + which are not capable of being achieved by simple documents between two people . While some of those rights/benefits govern interaction between the two , others govern interaction between the couple and outside agencies , like insurance companies , employers , hospitals , the government , etc . . If Joe and Mary sign an agreement that says she will be covered under his policy , does that mean the employer has to honor such an agreement ? No . That &apos;s a bit like throwing out the baby with the bath - water ... Drain the dirty water . Prepare good water . Then wash the baby with the new system . I do n&apos;t think the goal has anything to do with `` family unit &apos;&apos; ( unless we are defining `` family &apos;&apos; as just a couple ) , so I think we agree there . Of those 1,000 + benefits / rights , absolutely none of them are enhanced by the presence of offspring . Absolutely none of them are detracted from by the absence of offspring .

You have backed off of this argument and now claim it is supplemented by this testimony and presumptuous math . The testimony merely states that rescission is making millions for the health insurance companies . For now we can leave alone the obvious point that rescission and denials do n&apos;t really effect the cost of health care and minimally effect the number uninsured which are the primary arguments for health care reform . Instead , we can just concentrate on this diversion from the real issue . At this time I &apos; d like to point out that Kaiser no longer does rescission and has n&apos;t since 2006 and has offered to reinstate those who were effected in California . Statement from Kaiser Permanente Regarding Coverage of Former Kaiser Permanente Members | Kaiser Permanente News Center Pacificare had some 51 in 2 years and BCBS of CA had some 1,600 + over 4 years . Apparently with Pacificare a lot of these were people who said they were not pregnant who really were . In other words they committed fraud . Also in California Kaiser we find this out : `` The DMHC upheld our rescissions over 90 percent of the time when members appealed our decisions . We were upheld in 67 of 71 appeals by the DMHC . In 2004 and 2005 , the DMHC did not reverse any of our rescission decisions - every appeal was upheld . In 2006 , we started seeing a few reversals . &apos;&apos; BCBS of California in 2007 agreed to stop rescission without just cause and , in agreement with California , they submitted a new form . So what we can find when we do n&apos;t look at Huffington Post all day ? So where does this leave us ? Still with .5 % of the insured having rescission happen to them . Still not knowing WHO this is actually effecting . I &apos; ve shown testimony that they do n&apos;t look at the size of the claim but whether or not the discovered error of fact causes a material difference in the policy . Therefore it is not reasonable to assume this would happen to the top 5 % . People have been canceled when they go to the doctor and get blood work done only !

You ca n&apos;t just insist that because you have been a conservative Christian for a long time that you know what conservative gay Christians think .

But you referred in an earlier post to `` countless people &apos;&apos; I am not sure exactly what `` countless people &apos;&apos; means , but it sounded to me like you claiming that there are many closeted conservative gay Christians , which is what `` countless people &apos;&apos; sounds like . But you have no evidence for this . The existence of an `` ex - gay movement &apos;&apos; is not even very good evidence , as the founders of the `` ex - gay ministry &apos;&apos; called Exodus have recently repudiated the whole thing and have apologized for ever starting this `` ex - gay ministry . &apos;&apos; Interestingly , they have said that they are still evangelical Christians . But they never did become `` ex - gay , &apos;&apos; and they have said that their whole `` ex - gay &apos;&apos; enterprise never turned anyone `` ex - gay . &apos;&apos; These folks , one of whom is Michael Bussee , are interesting because they are examples of committed evangelical gay Christians who now argue that gay people should be accepted as they are . My point about gay people in the cities was simply to show that gay people are not equally distributed in the wider population , because gay people often move to places where they feel welcome and accepted and can find a community . Just as many gay people move to cities to find acceptance within a community , many gay people leave conservative Christian churches and find other churches where they feel welcome and accepted . The closet is not the issue here . The motivation of many gay Christians , whether they are closeted or not , is to find churches that do not denigrate who they are and do not insist that their living full lives with families is a `` sin . &apos;&apos; That was certainly the motivation of dozens of gay people whom I know who have left conservative Christian churches . I am one of them . Whether I know more than you about this is not the issue . The issue is that you have been making claims about what GAY conservative Christians supposedly believe and think , and you have NOT known hundreds of GAY conservative Christians . You say you have known personally only a `` few &apos;&apos; conservative gay Christians . So you really do not know what gay conservative Christians think . We are not talking about what heterosexual conservative Christians think , because they can believe that homosexuality is a sin without sacrificing anything . It takes no courage to believe that homosexuality is a sin if you &apos; re heterosexual . You can just point fingers at other people and make claims about other people &apos;s sin , and you do n&apos;t have to give up anything . There is no courage in that . It &apos;s doing exactly what Jesus said not to do : to judge others . These heterosexual conservative Christians may indeed have a deep spiritual belief about this , at the expense of other people . It &apos;s the gay conservative Christians whom these very spiritual heterosexual Christians expect either to deny who they are or try to change who they are . As I said before , heterosexual conservative Christians expect gay people to live their entire lives single , without a family , or else to try to change their nature into someone they are not . But these heterosexual Christians never impose that requirement on themselves . They just impose it on gay people . That &apos;s why so many gay people leave these conservative Christian churches . You wrote this : `` These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality -- ways that you do n&apos;t know about , frankly ... Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them .

You presume to know what makes people tick even though you do n&apos;t know them . You can not assume that gay conservative Christians think as you do . Their experience is not yours . Yet you are making this assumption . I do n&apos;t assume that I know what they think either , which is why I asked some of them about it . Yes , it &apos;s possible . Now there is a fair statement . THE conservative Christian viewpoint ? You imagine that all conservative Christians share one viewpoint ? You imagine that GAY conservative Christians share this same viewpoint ? How do you know they do ? Just as there is not one gay viewpoint , there is not one conservative Christian viewpoint , from what I have seen . There are many different viewpoints . There &apos;s the problem : your assertion that there is one `` mindset &apos;&apos; and that conservative gay Christians have it . You can not speak for them , because you do n&apos;t have any evidence of what they think . You know what YOU think , not what conservative gay Christians think . Similarly , I can not speak for other gay people . The fact that I am gay does not mean I know what all gay people think . I speak only for myself , unless I have evidence of what other gay people think . I &apos; ll say more about that when I have some more time . My daughter is calling me to spend time with her . But what you are saying the Bible says is just your interpretation of what the Bible says . It &apos;s not that liberal Christians are `` re - interpreting &apos;&apos; what the Bible says . All Christians are interpreting the Bible . Conservative Christians are interpreting the Bible to say what they believe about homosexuality . The Bible in its original languages never said anything about `` homosexuality . &apos;&apos; The term did n&apos;t even exist . And it &apos;s an interpretation to believe that the Bible forbids same - sex sex . Plus the Bible calls for the death penalty for men who lie with men as with a woman , and most conservative Christians conveniently ignore that ( Fred Phelps does n&apos;t ignore it . ) Your assertion that `` it &apos;s not rocket science &apos;&apos; to figure out that same - sex marriage `` does not jibe &apos;&apos; with scripture is clearly your interpretation of the Bible &apos;s complete silence on same - sex marriage . You assume , based on your other interpretations , that the Bible must intend to condemn same - sex marriage . But it never does . You are interpreting silence to mean what conservative Christians think it should mean . I disagree .

I await your reply ...",,284649,"* * Please go back and reread for comprehension . I did not deny , or affirm , that they ` did &apos; , because I only have your word for it that they do . I did affirm that they ` could &apos; , and so presumably , ` would &apos; , on occasion . But most importantly I affirmed , for the gazillionth time , that it does not matter to our issue whether or or not certain ` loci &apos; are subject to accidental/entropic dislocation . I do not care if they are sometimes accidentally altered or not , since we know from modern genomics that that the identity of ` genes &apos; and the ` traits &apos; they cue for are not mechanically determined , andsince they are not mechanically determined is does not matter whether or not you can find some statistical correlation between a particular nucleotide and a particular trait , or not . We went over this many times wrt L&amp;D &apos; 43 , where you claimed that the repeated mutation that led to resistance was ` random &apos; , despite the fact that it is obviously systematic . You tried the same thing recently with L&amp;L &apos; 51 , -- [ a piece of work that Joshua Lederberg is not all that proud of , apparently , since it does not turn up at his website , so far as I can tell ] . The fact that a nucleotide can and does change does not tell why it changed , and just assuming , as darwinists always have , that random but specific genetic change must lead irresistably to some specific organismic change , 1 to 1 , linearly , chemically , mechanically , deterministicly , is simply no longer credible in the light of modern molecular biology , genomics , or whatever . But without that now outdated assumption , the notion that adaptive traits can arise from genetic accidents does not hold water . Simply because , after discovering a repeating mutation that alternately leads to and from a costly but effective trait , such as e.coli . &apos;s resistance , you try to argue backwards to that mutation arising and being adaptive as a matter of pure accident , simply because you can now deliberately bombard the poor bacteria with x - rays or whatever , and so induce that same mutation . But what you can do now that the mutation has been systematized gives no grounds whatsoever for saying that that mutation originally arose by bombarding e.coli . with x - rays , or by any other purely accidental means . Modern genomics tells us that nucleotides , genes , are ways of coding for traits , and that , at least chemically , that coding can be different for the same trait , or the same for different traits , and so now it is apparent to everyone but darwinists that the chemicals are not in charge here -- that they are mere tools that do as they are told , recording for posterity certain very helpful and indeed , very often vital bits of infomation . Information that can be ` written &apos; in different ways , or different information that can be , in chemical terms , ` written &apos; using the exact same symbology . In light of that , continuing to insist that the original mutation , as per e.coli . , arose accidentally by genetic mutation , [ rather than was simply ` written &apos; that way by an organism learning to protect itself from an ancient and constant enemy , streptomyces ] , just because , millions of years after it was originated/evolved , lab teks can now turn on this mutation intentionally , with radiation , simply does not hold water . * * Well , I keep telling you why we are not on the same page at all , and you keep trying to distort what I say instead of coming to grips with it , so I really do n&apos;t believe that you and I will ever reach an understanding on this . * * I &apos; ve been saying since forever that chemical changes of any kind can and do happen accidentally/unintentionally , and that systemic changes can and do happen entropically . The simple fact of random genetic mutations has never been an issue with me , not on this bb or any other . I have never ever said that a certain nucleotide alterations could not have occurred by accident . But I have repeatedly said that an adaptive organismic change could not have originated/evolved purely and simply as a determined mechanical result of a random , accidental , genetic mutation . These are two very different issues . Just try and find a statement of mine where my words ever said anything different . This is about the six or seventh time you &apos; ve noticed that I &apos; ve agreed with you about random changes in nucleotides , but because I do not go on as you would like , to say that any given change in a given nucleotide , be it intentional or random , must lead to the origin/evolution of a novel , particular , organismic trait adaptation , you refuse to take yes for an answer . Nor will I accept your assumption that a genetic mutation that confers an organismic benefit today must have originated that ability by accident , simply because that genetic mutation can occur accidentally . You assume that originally a ` mutation &apos; caused the trait , whereas I do not . I affirm that the organism caused the trait , and then recorded it for posterity in genetic code . Before it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing , or at least , conferred no adaptive benefit , but after the organism ` wrote it out &apos; that way , the ensuing ` random &apos; mutations now had the same effect as the organismic mutation that originally connected its genetic chemistry to the biological trait it had already created for itself , epigenetically . Now , as I &apos; ve told you before , our views are irreconcilable , and we are at an impasse , unless and until you can demonstrate unequivocably , by an empirically factual example , that a random nucleotide change can and does lead directly and without organismic control or influence to some novel adaptive trait . And the only way that you can do that is to provide an example of a genetic mutation that occurs without being the result of an organismic , systematic response to any environmental stimulus acting upon the organism or its forebears , present or past . Just a straightforward accidental genetic change that has never conferred any adaptive benefit of any kind to that organism and/or its antecedents , to date . That is , genetic mutation . i.e. , a novel gene , that mechanically and deterministically does create an organismic trait mutation ; -- just not an adaptive one to any proximate stimulus . After all , ` random genetic mutations &apos; can not be expected to ` hold back &apos; on expressing themselves as traits until the need for them arises , can they ? Then you have to show that this non - adaptive organismic trait , as generated by this accidental genetic mutation , can and does prove adaptive to a novel , unanticipated environmental stimulus which it will encounter by sheer coincidence , i.e. , randomly , [ albeit with a little help from the lab tekkies ] , in its very near future . Then and only then will you have validated the primary assertion , the ` sine qua non &apos; , of `` NDT &apos;&apos; ; that a random genetic mutations mechanically develop organismic traits that are not adaptive to any environmental stimulus at the time they originate , but which can and do become coincidentally adaptive wrt novel random environmental factors which organisms will randomly encounter in their own futures , or in their future offspring &apos;s futures .",,Control_79,"Respectfully , I submit someone may be doing you a disservice in your correspondence area .",Formal,359809,"General Washington was basing his conclusions on the performance of the militia throughout the war up until that point in time , not just on one specific incident .

I think the view that religion is harmful as a generality is very much out of the mainstream , and it certainly does n&apos;t fit observation . In most cases , it &apos;s not harmful , so the discussion that it even needs a ` pass &apos; is moot , IMO . Where it IS quantifiably harmful , such as when we see nutcases killing abortion doctors in the name of religion , it does n&apos;t get a pass . That &apos;s exactly why so many religious groups condemned the recent case of such . I prefer to add another qualifier and say that `` Ridiculous harmful ideas should not be afforded any level of courtesy and respect . &apos;&apos; My observation is that the vast majority of religious people are not harmful with their religion . In cases where people are using their religion as an impetus for harm , that &apos;s a wholly different story and in that case I would agree that it should not be respected and instead should be condemned . But not religion as it plays out with most people . I also think that it &apos;s a generalisation to say that religion disallows criticism of itself . In fact , religion can sometimes be it &apos;s own biggest critic . I think that &apos;s exactly what we see Jesus doing in the way he deallt with the Pharisees in the gospels . Harmful religion causes harm , not just religion itself . What you &apos; re doing is engaging in the same sort of fallacy when people say `` sex causes STDs &apos;&apos; instead of saying `` unprotected sex causes STDs . &apos;&apos; Now , are there examples where religion causes harm that it DOES get a pass ? Yes , of course . But I think these are the exceptions in terms of how religion is typically conducted in every - day folks , and so the sweeping idea that religion is a negative thing is unfair , IMO ; it &apos;s an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater . And I realize ( if I understand your view correctly ) that your position is that even the mere belief in religious things is harmful , but I think that &apos;s a huge stretch . Even if the things religion professes to believe in are not empirically true , non - truism does not equate to harm , by default . I also realize ` harm &apos; can be an eye - of-the-beholder matter ; I &apos; ve pointed that out myself before . But largely I think this comes down to giving the benefit of the doubt -- having a tolerant standard for views over which we do n&apos;t agree , and then condemning them only when we believe there is clear harm . I do n&apos;t think you can quantify or qualify harm over nothing more than believing in an old man in the sky , or a flying spaghetti monster .",,134209,"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,158783,00.html .

You are trying to take empathy out of the picture , which is disingenuous on your part . Do you claim that empathy played no role ? Yes , it was not ants that were suffering but people but it was not an abstract arbitrary assignment of a definition of person that drove the abolitionist movement - it was empathy with beings like oneself . As for enslaved robots , currently there is no developed artificial intelligence but many a science fiction movie has been based on the concept of rights of sentient robots . It may be an issue our society may someday need to face decades from now . Until they are sentient , their rights are irrelevant - just as with a pre - mentally existing fetuses . Perhaps I am misunderstanding you , but the assumptions I claim were made by 19th century supporters of Slavery were indeed largely disprovable ( appart from the ones that came from a distorted Christian faith ) . These assumptions included the Southerners claim that blacks were like children who needed supervision , and they were automatically inferior because of their race . A simply proof could have been to let a sample group be brought up and live under the same condition as whites and see what comes of it . I have very little doubt that the result would have run counter to the Southerner &apos;s claims . Do you think otherwise ? Also , what assumptions do you say are `` obviously generally accepted today &apos;&apos; ? Perhaps I missed something since I do n&apos;t know what you are referring to . What one defines as the minimum definition of `` person &apos;&apos; is arbitrary : - I ( and presumably chemist99a ) define person as human with some level of mind - You define a person as a living entity with a complete set of human DNA that has started the growth process ( which are the main characteristics of a zygote ) - Someone else might define a person as an unfertilized egg or a sperm cell which , after all , are human , alive , and have the potential to become one of us - they simply lack the second set of DNA to get the process started . Your definition is as arbitrary as anyone elses . So , we can not just randomly choose a definition of `` person &apos;&apos; and then say `` all person &apos;s have rights &apos;&apos; . We need to supply REASONS behind what type of being has rights . That is why it is important to address the question about why people have rights in the first place . How do you propose to answer that question . Do you prefer that we all fight it out over an arbitrary definition ? I think rational debate is preferable . So ... let &apos;s give some rational reasons behind our concept of human rights . Lastly , I do not think that chemist99a chose to define the convention of who gets rights by randomly choosing it . I am sure that he had reasons behind choosing that convention . If you think that the convention he presents is arbitrary and that yours is not , then why do n&apos;t the two of you compare the rational arguements behind the chosen convention and then debate those rational arguements instead of continuing an essentially silly arguement about a definition of `` person &apos;&apos; . If , by the word `` person &apos;&apos; , you both mean a human with rights , then does n&apos;t it make sense to address the question of the reasons behind having rights ?",

Now those percentages are 20 % and 30 % respectively , and are shrinking . Jerusalem Christians were a plurality in the 1920s ; today , they number under 2 percent of the city &apos;s population . Serious violations of religious freedom are reported from within the Palestinian Authority , especially the persecution of Muslims who have converted to Christianity . In the Christian town of Bet Jella , a human rights lawyer reported brutal interrogation methods and arbitrary arrests based on fabricated criminal charges against Muslims who have converted to Christianity and their families . His report includes testimony about torture from victims who were terrified to criticize the Palestinian Authority and their secret police . In Nazareth , the Christian population has decreased dramatically due to the rise and spread of militant Islam . The Islamic Movement ( a radical Muslim group ) has demanded the construction of a mosque near the Church of the Annunciation , a mosque even some moderate Muslims oppose . On Easter , 1999 , the Muslim group burned Christian stores and targeted Christians over the issue ; attempts to intervene were frustrated because Christians are terrified to speak out . Hundreds of Christian families have left Palestinian towns like Bet Jella and Bethlehem during the al - Aqsa intifada , caught literally in the crossfire between Palestinians and Israelis . On the West Bank , a nearly - permanent Muslim boycott of Christian businesses is achieving its objective : driving the Christians to emigrate . In October 2000 , Christians were attacked in Gaza after a Palestinian Muslim leader called for a `` jihad &apos;&apos; against both Jews and Christians . In February 2002 a Muslim mob , including Palestinian Authority Special Forces , burned Christian businesses and attempted to destroy the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in Ramallah . The attack occurred after a Christian man killed a Muslim while being pursued by a Muslim gang because he refused to pay protection money for safe passage to his home . &apos;&apos; http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_current_christians.php See also THE BELEAGUERED CHRISTIANS OF THE PALESTINIAN - CONTROLLED AREAS http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=14002 Arafat &apos;s Terrorism Threatens Christians and Christian Sites ...

Arabic did not spread like English , French or other similar languages that spread through commercial and diplomatic excellence of the lending nation and filtered through the top strata of the receiving : countries . Arabic was injected through all strata of the conquered population which did not have much choice in the matter . Thus we have a series of countries that are ` Arabic &apos; in race , culture and language extending from Iraq to Morocco . Conversion was not confined to creed alone , it covered one &apos;s ancestry as well . &apos;&apos; http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/genocide.html Quite frankly , I recognise the crimes of Israel commits against Arabs ; Muslim and Christian . * What I really object to your Turing this into a perpetrator/victim dichotomy that ignores atrocities committed by ` your side &apos; . You have put forward factual errors , and leaps of logics . You have bent the rules of geography to create a ` Palestine &apos; that sits solely within what is now Israel - when Palestine was bigger in an ` historic &apos; sense . So , by limiting geography , and time , you see only actions conducted by Israel against the Palestinians . And you feel this is so wrong that you would deny Israel even the right to exist ( your previous exchange with me , you said you would deny Israel ` everything &apos; ) . Effectively you &apos; ve jumped on a wagon pulled by Islamicists who want the west to feel bad about well , everything . Israel at least , is a democracy ( although with a very hostile minority ) .

I never said he was n&apos;t . So I did n&apos;t vote for Obama . But neither RAN as a liberal . They BOTH tried to come across as conservative . That &apos;s what candidates have to do . Just because these are general ideals that most people adhere to ( which is really all you &apos; ve got to go on in terms of defense here it seems ) only goes to show that most people really tend to BE conservative on these issues .

I personally do n&apos;t see any justified authority for allowing any doctor to invade a patient &apos;s privacy and ask personal questions regarding how they exercise their constitutional rights . Such standards would be quickly shot down if doctors were asking their patients if they chose to practice hinduism rather than christianity . We &apos; d never stand for a questionnaire asking patients if they supported an amnesty program or a closed border policy . And we certainly would n&apos;t tolerate a doctor asking patients if they planned to vote liberal or conservative in the next election and why . Why would n&apos;t we support these ? Because they &apos; re not medically relevant . And neither is gun ownership . And while that &apos;s tragic that is simply NOT the concern of doctors . And I agree with that fully . A doctor &apos;s right to free speech does n&apos;t apply to invading the political privacy of their patients .
