guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles.<br><b>Sent 9: </b>Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage.<br><b>Sent 10: </b>After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan.<br><b>Sent 11: </b>The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft.<br><b>Sent 12: </b>Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed.<br><b>Sent 13: </b>Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position.<br><b>Sent 14: </b>Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option.<br><b>Sent 15: </b>He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position.<br><b>Sent 16: </b>Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible.<br><b>Sent 17: </b>The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia.<br><b>Sent 18: </b>The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.<br>","<div class=""boxedBig""><b>Question: </b> What option does Zinni not recall blocking  &nbsp;

Erlenborn, president of the Legal Services Corp., the entity that doles out federal money for legal aid, will announce at the conference that Illinois will suffer ""seven-figure funding cuts"" next year because of newly released census figures.<br><b>Sent 4: </b>Under federal law, money for legal aid is distributed to the states based on the number of indigent residents.<br><b>Sent 5: </b>Erlenborn, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the Chicago area, did not disclose how big the state's hit would be but issued a statement Thursday pointing out that only four states would lose more federal money than Illinois in 2003.<br><b>Sent 6: </b>Last year, the LSC gave Illinois nearly $12 million -- or a third of the money going to the state's legal aid programs -- to fund the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago, Prairie State Legal Services and Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation.<br><b>Sent 7: </b>Legal aid providers in the state are already scrounging for funding as interest rates fall through the floor, because one of their primary sources of support comes from the interest generated on client assets held in trust by lawyers in Illinois.<br><b>Sent 8: </b>Illinois Supreme Court Justice Thomas L. Kilbride will deliver the keynote speech to the legal aid providers on Monday and will discuss the high court's plan to hike attorney registration fees by $42 to cover the shortfall in the interest income.<br><b>Sent 9: </b>The high court floated a plan during the spring legislative session to raise those fees, which would bring in roughly $2.4 million and raise the base fee for active attorneys from $180 to $222.<br><b>Sent 10: </b>That proposal languished, but many observers noted that the high court could raise the fees without legislative approval.<br><b>Sent 11: </b>Organizers of the conference acknowledged that much of the discussion at the event will center on how to use resources most effectively on a shoestring budget.<br><b>Sent 12: </b>In fact, all of the hotel rooms and conference facilities were donated to the group after another organization announced at the end of June that it was calling off its convention, leaving the facilities open, said Linda Zazove, deputy director of Land of Lincoln and a member of the conference's planning committee.<br><b>Sent 13: </b>A core group of legal aid attorneys hatched the idea of a conference after visiting with representatives of similar programs in other states who regularly hold such meetings, she said.<br><b>Sent 14: </b>Originally, the organizers hoped for a fall convention but they sprang at the opportunity when the rooms opened up.<br><b>Sent 15: </b>""This is a unique opportunity for people who are in the trenches delivering services to get together, meet each other and share ideas,"" Zazove said.<br><b>Sent 16: </b>The providers will attend sessions on car-related consumer law, bankruptcy, immigration, welfare, assisting pro se clients, recruiting private attorneys and Internet resources for both advocates and clients.<br><b>Sent 17: </b>Ruth Ann Schmitt, executive director of the Lawyers Trust Fund, which is covering some of the costs of the gathering, acknowledged that the legal aid community faces many problems but said the meeting could give attorneys a morale boost.<br><b>Sent 18: </b>""It's not often that the rank and file get together to talk about their problems....
