City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of £49million in each window and keeping the club's overall wage bill to its current level of £205million-a-year. UEFA's settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club's latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of £23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £25m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. 'I think that next season we don't have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,' said Pellegrini. 'It's important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.' Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe's biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including £30m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA's Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City's financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: 'Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. They have successfully argued their case with UEFA before. Last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their Champions League squad had been reduced. Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for £32m last summer . The reigning Premier League champions have only paid money for Fernando, Willie Caballero, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony in the last two transfer windows and that was part-paid by the sales of Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Pellegrini admitted they weren't in a position to compete with neighbours United for established world stars like Angel di Maria because of the FFP penalties. It has cost City on the pitch. Even if they win their remaining eight Premier League fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. Pellegrini and director of football Txiki Begiristain both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players. Manchester City have been heavily linked with a move for former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne . The club also want to be involved in any race for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling . They have been strongly linked with former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne who has been one of the best players in the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg. And if Liverpool do allow Sterling to leave, City want to be involved in the chase for one of England's most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players. 'If you are the manager or a player of a big tem, you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance,' he said. 'The major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season I think we were the team that spent less than any other team. That is the weird thing. 'For this club trying to be a big team in so few years, maybe we are paying the cost for that.' Since the transfer penalties were introduced, City have spent £91million on players in the last two windows (Net spend £68million). That compares to Manchester United £145.5million, Liverpool £113million, Arsenal £92.5million and Chelsea £82.6million.

But can a woman with 34G curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress? SECRET SUPPORT . Lace pencil dress, £169, Monsoon.co.uk . Blue caged heels, £39.99, Zara.com . I would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than I am. This one manages the impossible. The narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs, making me look taller and slimmer, and the bustline is quite high, hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look. What I really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem, which softens the silhouette. But while looking summery, the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support, boosted by the Chantelle strapless bra I wear underneath all the dresses. Great for summer weddings. 4/5 . ONE FOR TEENS . Prom-style dress, £58.99, Chichiclothing.com . Gold sandals, £34,99, newlook.com . This might look lovely on a teenage girl, but on me — eek! At 48 I'm at least 30 years too old to carry it off. The material is flimsy and there's almost no structure, so my bust looks horribly saggy. And the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as I am on top — not a good look. Forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare. 1/5 . FLATTERING AND COMFY . Floral maxi dress, £72, Asos.com . The large, floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect. It distracts the eye which instantly slims you. This is a relaxed, 1970s style, so anything too fitted would look out of place. The best thing is how comfortable it feels. You could wear it anywhere — to the beach, to a garden party, or to an evening do. A winner, and at a great price, too. 5/5 . SHORT... BUT NOT SWEET . Mini dress, £45, Riverisland.com; Strap-heeled sandals, £39.99, Zara.com . This clings well and gives me a neat waistline. The bandeau-style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down. But below the waist it's a different story. Quite frankly, the skirt is far too short. I've always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs: doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking. I'd have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer. 2/5 . OSCAR WORTHY . Double layer maxi dress, £110, Jarlolondon.co.uk . This clever design has a double layer: the lining clings tightly, but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette. The overall look is statuesque and Grecian. The vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan. In it, I feel like Cameron Diaz going up for an Oscar. I'm ready for my close-up. 5/5 . I LOOK SO SLIM . Sweetheart neckline dress, £150, Coast-stores.com; Heels. £485, biondacastana.com . This sophisticated little summery frock has a sweetheart neckline, which curves down to show a bit of cleavage and then rises up to cover the breasts on either side, striking the perfect balance between flirtiness and discretion. As well as being flattering, the bodice is structured and well-made, minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it's needed — there's no way I'll be falling out of this frock. The clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect, slimming down my bottom and hips, and falling flatteringly below the knee. I can certainly imagine myself going to a summer wedding in this little green number. 4/5 .",The strapless dress is a red carpet staple for fine-boned actresses such as Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of £49million in each window and keeping the club's overall wage bill to its current level of £205million-a-year. UEFA's settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club's latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of £23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £25m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. 'I think that next season we don't have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,' said Pellegrini. 'It's important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.' Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe's biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including £30m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA's Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City's financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: 'Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward.

Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for £32m last summer .

But there's a new superfood on the block, which is thought to enhance your mood, renew skin and even help with menopause symptoms. Reaping with beauty and health benefits, experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil, which is being touted as the the new must-have - and, of course, health aficionado Gwyneth Paltrow is already a fan. Health gurus are touting pumpkin seed oil as the next big thing - and say it can help enhance your mood, renew skin and even reduce menopause symptoms (just ask Gwyneth Paltrow, who features it in many of her recipes in her book, It's All Good) Much like coconut oil, pumpkin seed oil is thought to help boost shiny locks. Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help strengthen hair and even help boost hair growth. When applied to the lengths of your locks, PowerHealth, who supply the health produce, say it  hydrates hair follicles giving shiny and lustrous strands. It also apparently has similar skin-boosting benefits. With high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antioxidants, pumpkin seed oil helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture, which ensures skin is hydrated and youthful. Zinc and vitamin E from the pumpkin seed can also improve the skin's healing process, helping to fight off acne, beat scarring and maintain skin renewal. Pumpkin seeds, left, are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help, strengthen hair. The oil, right, can be drizzled onto food or applied directly to skin and hair to help boost your beauty and health . Studies have even found that pumpkin seeds are a mood-boosting food. Pumpkin seeds and chia seeds topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson. One of the richest sources of tryptophan, pumpkin seeds increase production of serotonin, a hormone that can help improve people's mood and help us feel relaxed. With a high zinc content, which plays a central role in boosting the immune system and cell division, pumpkin seeds can increase brain power by enhancing memory and focus, claim nutritionists. The potent seeds are also thought to help beat menopausal symptoms. The little seeds are said to be rich in natural phytoestrogens, which can decrease blood pressure, headaches, hot flushes, joint pain and other menopausal symptoms. Pumpkin seeds, pictured, topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson . Nutritional therapist Angela Falaschi told The Telegraph: 'Hot flushes are one of the most common and distressing symptoms of the menopause, with extreme highs and lows in temperature causing episodes of profuse sweating. 'I often recommend supplementing the diet with isoflavonoids (naturally occurring compounds) by incorporating chick peas, soya, lentils and pumpkin seeds into your meals.' Gwyneth Paltrow, who penned cookbook It's All Good, loves to use the nutrient-rich seeds in her healthy recipes. Lorna Driver-Davies, Nutritionist at NutriCentre, said: 'Pumpkin seed oil is high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (a longer chain fatty acid) omega 6, which is beneficial for the skin and hormone support in women. I also recommend pumpkin seed oil to men due to the zinc content. 'But we must be careful to not use too much omega 6 oils in our diet as we need less of them than we do omega 3. A source of omega 3 would be oily fish. When using any nutritional oils, we should all be aware that balance is key and use a wide variety of sources; coconut, pumpkin and fish, for example.'",pumpkin seed oil is thought to boost shiny locks and fight off menopause symptoms. it also helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture. the oil can be applied directly to your skin and hair to help boost your mood.,t5_zeroshot

""I thought we were done,"" he said Thursday, one day later. ""There was no doubt in my mind that we weren't going to land."" Johnson was flying with his brother, his girlfriend and his 8-month-old son when he says a flight attendant came over the speaker asking for someone who was medically trained to help with a sick passenger. Minutes later, Johnson says, the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing. ""You're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded, and you're not going to be able to breathe,"" Johnson recalled the flight attendant saying. The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with SkyWest Flight 5622, and said it would investigate. It later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues. ""It was like being trapped and you couldn't do anything. You have no control over it. Your body just felt pressured,"" Johnson said. Johnson said his girlfriend was seeing spots and that ""when I was blinking, it was really bright. I could barely see."" According to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest, three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight. Fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the Buffalo airport, but no one was transported to the hospital, she said. The spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft, an Embraer E170, and that the airline continues to investigate the cause. An official with the National Transportation Safety Board told CNN that the agency is in communication with the FAA and SkyWest to gather information on the incident to better understand what took place. Mary Cunningham was the nurse on board who attended to the first sick passenger. ""There was a woman, very lethargic, very nauseous, turning gray, just not looking good,"" Cunningham said. After administering oxygen to the woman, Cunningham, a nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, returned to her seat. Soon after, Cunningham said, she was called up again by the flight attendant after another women near the first started to lose consciousness. ""It was something that was affecting oxygen in that area,"" which was near the middle of the plane, she said. Cunningham said she had to return to her seat after feeling lightheaded. There were 84 passengers on board the plane, including nine crew members. Flight 5622 was originally scheduled to fly from Chicago to Hartford, Connecticut. The plane descended 28,000 feet in three minutes. ""It would feel like a roller coaster -- when you're coming over the top and you're going down,"" CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said, describing how such a descent would feel. ""You know that these pilots knew they were in a very grave and very serious situation."" Johnson, flying to visit his parents with their only grandchild, was glad that roller coaster ride ended safely. ""It was a shaky ride. It wasn't anything I would like to experience again,"" he said. CNN's Jean Casarez, Josh Gaynor, Dana Ford and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","""you're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded,"" Johnson says.

But there's a new superfood on the block, which is thought to enhance your mood, renew skin and even help with menopause symptoms. Reaping with beauty and health benefits, experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil, which is being touted as the the new must-have - and, of course, health aficionado Gwyneth Paltrow is already a fan. Health gurus are touting pumpkin seed oil as the next big thing - and say it can help enhance your mood, renew skin and even reduce menopause symptoms (just ask Gwyneth Paltrow, who features it in many of her recipes in her book, It's All Good) Much like coconut oil, pumpkin seed oil is thought to help boost shiny locks. Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help strengthen hair and even help boost hair growth. When applied to the lengths of your locks, PowerHealth, who supply the health produce, say it  hydrates hair follicles giving shiny and lustrous strands. It also apparently has similar skin-boosting benefits. With high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antioxidants, pumpkin seed oil helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture, which ensures skin is hydrated and youthful. Zinc and vitamin E from the pumpkin seed can also improve the skin's healing process, helping to fight off acne, beat scarring and maintain skin renewal. Pumpkin seeds, left, are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help, strengthen hair. The oil, right, can be drizzled onto food or applied directly to skin and hair to help boost your beauty and health . Studies have even found that pumpkin seeds are a mood-boosting food. Pumpkin seeds and chia seeds topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson. One of the richest sources of tryptophan, pumpkin seeds increase production of serotonin, a hormone that can help improve people's mood and help us feel relaxed. With a high zinc content, which plays a central role in boosting the immune system and cell division, pumpkin seeds can increase brain power by enhancing memory and focus, claim nutritionists. The potent seeds are also thought to help beat menopausal symptoms. The little seeds are said to be rich in natural phytoestrogens, which can decrease blood pressure, headaches, hot flushes, joint pain and other menopausal symptoms. Pumpkin seeds, pictured, topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson .

""I thought we were done,"" he said Thursday, one day later. ""There was no doubt in my mind that we weren't going to land."" Johnson was flying with his brother, his girlfriend and his 8-month-old son when he says a flight attendant came over the speaker asking for someone who was medically trained to help with a sick passenger. Minutes later, Johnson says, the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing. ""You're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded, and you're not going to be able to breathe,"" Johnson recalled the flight attendant saying. The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with SkyWest Flight 5622, and said it would investigate. It later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues. ""It was like being trapped and you couldn't do anything. You have no control over it. Your body just felt pressured,"" Johnson said. Johnson said his girlfriend was seeing spots and that ""when I was blinking, it was really bright. I could barely see."" According to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest, three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight. Fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the Buffalo airport, but no one was transported to the hospital, she said. The spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft, an Embraer E170, and that the airline continues to investigate the cause. An official with the National Transportation Safety Board told CNN that the agency is in communication with the FAA and SkyWest to gather information on the incident to better understand what took place. Mary Cunningham was the nurse on board who attended to the first sick passenger. ""There was a woman, very lethargic, very nauseous, turning gray, just not looking good,"" Cunningham said. After administering oxygen to the woman, Cunningham, a nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, returned to her seat.

The unnamed caller gave the operator a blow-by-blow account as he wandered behind Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, in Silver Spring on Sunday. The 7-minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who espouse the hands-off parenting style. The caller, who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to Washington, DC, said he saw 'two kids that are unaccompanied, and they've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves.' Scene: The 911 call that reignited the 'free-range' parenting controversy for two Maryland parents has been released and reveals that Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the Washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver Spring on Sunday . The operator asked, 'Have you talked to them to see, you know, why are they just walking around by themselves?' 'No, no, they came up and asked to pet my dog, I let them, and that was it...I don't want to scare them,' he said. The man continued to tail the children, who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed, until police arrived. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","the caller was over in the vicinity of the washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver spring on sunday. he saw the children, 10, and 6, walking to their parents' house and asked, 'why are they walking around by themselves?' when he saw them he answered 'yes' and managed to tail them. the 'free-range' parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have vowed to sue authorities for",t5_zeroshot

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike  Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it's a lot of work and  it's also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need -  it's entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children's diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they're young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they're young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they're not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and  they don't have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they're running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that's really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don't know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can't get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they'd usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. 'I'm not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I'm not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it's okay as well as long as it's a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban  foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There's sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's  not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get  the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It's almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they  praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book,  'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese  - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients,  has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they're loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something  unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'",children's cookbook author slams Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book. says it goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts would advise. says children need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need.,t5_zeroshot

The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients,  has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they're loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something  unhealthy food is pushed at them.

The unnamed caller gave the operator a blow-by-blow account as he wandered behind Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, in Silver Spring on Sunday. The 7-minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who espouse the hands-off parenting style. The caller, who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to Washington, DC, said he saw 'two kids that are unaccompanied, and they've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves.' Scene: The 911 call that reignited the 'free-range' parenting controversy for two Maryland parents has been released and reveals that Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the Washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver Spring on Sunday . The operator asked, 'Have you talked to them to see, you know, why are they just walking around by themselves?' 'No, no, they came up and asked to pet my dog, I let them, and that was it...I don't want to scare them,' he said. The man continued to tail the children, who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed, until police arrived. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike  Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it's a lot of work and  it's also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need -  it's entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children's diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they're young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they're young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they're not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and  they don't have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they're running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that's really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don't know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can't get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they'd usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. 'I'm not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I'm not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it's okay as well as long as it's a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban  foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike  Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it's a lot of work and  it's also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need -  it's entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children's diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they're young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they're young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they're not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and  they don't have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they're running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that's really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don't know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can't get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they'd usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. 'I'm not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I'm not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it's okay as well as long as it's a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban  foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There's sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's  not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get  the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It's almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they  praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book,  'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese  - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients,  has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they're loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something  unhealthy food is pushed at them.

The unnamed caller gave the operator a blow-by-blow account as he wandered behind Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, in Silver Spring on Sunday. The 7-minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who espouse the hands-off parenting style. The caller, who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to Washington, DC, said he saw 'two kids that are unaccompanied, and they've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves.' Scene: The 911 call that reignited the 'free-range' parenting controversy for two Maryland parents has been released and reveals that Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the Washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver Spring on Sunday . The operator asked, 'Have you talked to them to see, you know, why are they just walking around by themselves?' 'No, no, they came up and asked to pet my dog, I let them, and that was it...I don't want to scare them,' he said. The man continued to tail the children, who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed, until police arrived. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Rafi and Dvora Meitiv were seized by police and Maryland CPS on Sunday in Silver Spring, Maryland.

However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .Scientists Danielle and Alexander Meitiv believe in 'free range parenting' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy .The Meitivs were found guilty of neglect in March.

'That's the madness of it,' manager Eddie Howe said in the aftermath. 'I couldn't believe in one game we dropped to fourth. It's great for the neutral, but not so great for us.' The south coast club had not conceded the first goal at Dean Court this campaign and have struggled to get anything from losing positions, but comebacks rarely come better than being two behind after 21 minutes. Charlie Daniels (right) fires home from the edge of the box to seal the win and make it 4-2 to Bournemouth . Yann Kermorgant slots home a penalty to cap a remarkable comeback and make it 3-2 to Bournemouth . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Cook, Elphick, Daniels; Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Fraser (Smith 56); Kermorgant (Pitman 87), Wilson (Jones 88). Subs not used: Camp, Ward, Gosling, Stanislas.

Goals: Donaldson 18, Cotterill 21 . Manager: Gary Rowett . Booked: Davis, Ground, . Sent off: Robinson (straight red) Referee: Andy Woolmer . Stadium: The Goldsands Stadium . Attendance: 11,084 . Watford temporarily moved top by beating Middlesbrough, who started the day as leaders, in the lunch-time kick-off and Norwich then went above them with victory against Sheffield Wednesday. But Bournemouth have been this season's pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. 'We want eight,' the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. 'That didn't feel too good,' Howe admitted. 'I'd be lying if I said nerves won' t come into it, it's only natural considering what's at stake.' But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level . Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down . Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1 . On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham's defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. 'I felt the officials were inconsistent,' Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.' If Birmingham's two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth's three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar. The game was over in the 77th minute when Robinson was sent off for a foul last man. Referee Andy Woolmer handed out a straight red card, but it was hard to make out amongst the Birmingham red faces. David Cotterill celebrates making it 2-0 to Birmingham after just 21 minutes . Clayton Donaldson (centre) opens the scoring for Birmingham with a sublime lob over Artur Boruc .

Dr Henry Miller of California's Stanford University led the effort and he was the first person to sign the letter, the New York Daily News reported. Miller said: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. 'I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' He told CBS News that 'a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution'. The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. From left to right, Dr Phil McGraw, financial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr Mehmet Oz and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in 2010 . The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain. 'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both. The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey. For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show. Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound. At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment. As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center. The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the""miracle"" diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted.","Dr Mehmet Oz is vice chairman at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons and is a professor of surgery .He said in a statement that his show provides 'multiple points of view', including his, 'which is offered without conflict of interest'Comes after ten top doctors sent letter to school urging for Oz's dismissal .Said there's no scientific proof his 'miracle' weight-loss supplements work .Columbia said it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom'University has not removed TV celebrity doctor from his faculty position .",references

Saints missed the chance to close the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to two points as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at the Britannia Stadium. Schneiderlin opened the scoring with his first Barclays Premier League goal since September, but a mistake from Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis allowed Mame Diouf to equalise and substitute Charlie Adam stole all three points with six minutes to go. Morgan Schneiderlin fires Southampton into the lead at the Britannia with a close-range finish . Schneiderlin accepts the Europa League is a more realistic goal for Southampton now, but he insists the players still have faint hopes of qualifying for the premier club competition in Europe. 'We wanted to achieve the top four and now it's going to be even more complicated but we're not going to give up,' the midfielder told Southampton's website. 'We wanted to give the fans the most prestigious competition but if not, we want to give them the Europa League. We want to secure European football for this club, that's our main target.' Stoke had struggled to create any decent chances before Davis' misjudgement handed them a way back into the game less than two minutes into the second half. The 38-year-old declined to catch Steven Nzonzi's shot, believing it was going wide. The ball struck the angle and the goalkeeper had no time to respond before Diouf swept in from eight yards. Schneiderlin (left) makes a run as Stoke's Steven Nzonzi gives chase on Saturday . Saints manager Ronald Koeman was loathe to criticise his goalkeeper after the match. 'I call it unlucky,' the Dutchman said. 'I will have to watch it back. I don't know if it was a cross or a shot, and maybe the wind was part of the difficulty for Kelvin.' Saints' demise was complete when substitute Adam nipped the ball away from Sadio Mane in the box and swept a volley past Davis. Mame Biram Diouf swept in from 10 yards as Stoke forced an equaliser in the 47th minute . After scoring a 65-yard wonder goal against Chelsea just a couple of weeks ago, Adam was unhappy at starting the game on the bench, but he thinks he gave his manager the perfect response. 'It's nice to keep scoring and win the game,' the Scot said. 'It was disappointing to be on the bench and I think it was a great way to react by not starting the game.' The win moved Stoke to within four points of their 50-point target for the season. Charlie Adam secured all three points for Stoke as the hit the winner with six minutes remaining . And Adam believes the Potters can make up the one-point gap that separates them from eighth-placed Swansea. He said: 'We're edging nearer to doing better than last season and since the manager came in, our aim is to keep improving year upon year. 'We are a top-10 club and we want to consolidate ourselves in that position, so we want to keep pushing on for the remaining games of the season. 'It will be difficult, but we will keep pushing on and if we can finish in eighth place then we will be very happy.'

But Bournemouth have been this season's pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. 'We want eight,' the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. 'That didn't feel too good,' Howe admitted. 'I'd be lying if I said nerves won' t come into it, it's only natural considering what's at stake.'

Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. 'I felt the officials were inconsistent,' Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty.

Joanessa Clawson, 35, her husband James Clawson, 38, and her mother Patti Ann Baldassarre, 68, from Marietta, Georgia, all face felony conspiracy charges. The GoFundMe page, which has now been removed, is written from the point of view of a family friend - who allegedly does not exist - appealing for help for the Clawson family. 'I am posting this for my friend Jo Clawson whose 3-year-old daughter, Sofia, is very ill with a life threatening heart infection,' it reads, according to an image of the page shared by KESQ. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Joanessa Clawson, left, and her husband James Clawson, right, face felony conspiracy charges after they allegedly set up a fake GoFundMe account asking for donations . 'Fake': They pretended to be a friend asking for money for their daughter, claiming that the girl was in hospital with a heart infection after surgery. They asked for $3,000 on the GoFundMe page . 'This happened 2 weeks after Sofia underwent heart surgery to repair a defect that she was born with. This fellow East Cobb family runs their own home-based business.' When shared by KESQ, the page, entitled 'Sofia's Medical and Family Expenses', had raised just $195 but was asking for $3,000. It is not clear how much money the page eventually raised. The couple has two children, the daughter and an older son, according to their Facebook pages. Friends told the channel that they had their suspicions about the fundraiser because their stories did not seem to add up - and the couple has been accused of running scams in the past. In 2006, they were accused by dozens of couples of accepting payments to take wedding photos in Cabazon, California but never delivering the images. Scam: Clawson's mother Patti Ann Baldassarre posed as a nurse to back up the couple's story . Speaking to KESQ, neighbors said they tried to alert police to the fake page months ago. 'There were tons of red flags and there were tons of people in the community who reached out just for the sake of her kids,' Sandra May said. 'And nothing was done.' When they voiced their suspicions, Mrs Clawson allegedly produced a note from a doctor providing the donors a number for a nurse if they had any concerns. But the number on the letter allegedly led to Baldassarre's phone, and the doctor named in the letter had retired years earlier, according to KESQ. After a teacher leaned of the page, she asked Cobb County School Police to check in on the three-year-old daughter and discovered that the child was in fact healthy. The trio was arrested on felony conspiracy charges. Mrs Clawson is also charged with felony theft by deception, while her husband faces an additional charge of misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer. He posted $5,000 bail but his wife remains behind bars on $10,000 bond and her mother is held on $2,500 bond. In 2006, more than 20 couples said they never received wedding photos despite paying the couple. Arrested: Mrs Clawson, pictured left and right with her older child, was arrested after a teacher asked police to check on the wellbeing of the three-year-old daughter and found she was fine, according to reports . Home: The couple moved to Marietta, Georgia (pictured) after allegedly running a wedding photography business in California - but they allegedly failed to give their clients photos after they were paid . They also accused them of stealing other photographers' work and claiming it was their own in order to promote their business. 'Hired Joanessa Clawson for July 2006 wedding in Los Angeles. Takes great photos but no where to be found once the wedding is over,' one enraged client wrote online in 2006. 'Once they get your check Joanessa and her husband, James, will make every excuse in the book on why you haven't received your photos!! (i.e. Joanessa has health problems from a stroke to the flu to a heart attack, FEDEX is to blame, they have other weddings to tend to etc). 'She may be more affordable than other photographers but in the end, you definitely get what you pay for, nothing.' KESQ reported that some of the clients took the Clawsons to court and won financial judgments.

Nyia Parler, 41, has been hospitalized for undisclosed reasons in Maryland ever since her 21-year-old son was found in a pile of wet leaves in Cobb Creek Park in Philadelphia last Friday. Police believe the man had been left in the woods all week - with nothing but a bible and a blanket - and was exposed to the rain and cold and to wild animals. He was found next to his wheelchair. Parler was initially charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping and neglect of a care-dependent person, and police have now added attempted murder to the list. Accused: Nyia Parler, 41, who is in hospital for undisclosed reasons, now faces an attempted murder charge for allegedly dumping her disabled son, 21, in the rainy and cold woods for five days . Charged: Parler (right) left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left), right.

The GoFundMe page, which has now been removed, is written from the point of view of a family friend - who allegedly does not exist - appealing for help for the Clawson family.

Scroll down for video . Arrested: Joanessa Clawson, left, and her husband James Clawson, right, face felony conspiracy charges after they allegedly set up a fake GoFundMe account asking for donations . 'Fake': They pretended to be a friend asking for money for their daughter, claiming that the girl was in hospital with a heart infection after surgery. They asked for $3,000 on the GoFundMe page . 'This happened 2 weeks after Sofia underwent heart surgery to repair a defect that she was born with. This fellow East Cobb family runs their own home-based business.' When shared by KESQ, the page, entitled 'Sofia's Medical and Family Expenses', had raised just $195 but was asking for $3,000. It is not clear how much money the page eventually raised. The couple has two children, the daughter and an older son, according to their Facebook pages. Friends told the channel that they had their suspicions about the fundraiser because their stories did not seem to add up - and the couple has been accused of running scams in the past. In 2006, they were accused by dozens of couples of accepting payments to take wedding photos in Cabazon, California but never delivering the images. Scam: Clawson's mother Patti Ann Baldassarre posed as a nurse to back up the couple's story . Speaking to KESQ, neighbors said they tried to alert police to the fake page months ago. 'There were tons of red flags and there were tons of people in the community who reached out just for the sake of her kids,' Sandra May said. 'And nothing was done.' When they voiced their suspicions, Mrs Clawson allegedly produced a note from a doctor providing the donors a number for a nurse if they had any concerns. But the number on the letter allegedly led to Baldassarre's phone, and the doctor named in the letter had retired years earlier, according to KESQ. After a teacher leaned of the page, she asked Cobb County School Police to check in on the three-year-old daughter and discovered that the child was in fact healthy. The trio was arrested on felony conspiracy charges. Mrs Clawson is also charged with felony theft by deception, while her husband faces an additional charge of misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer. He posted $5,000 bail but his wife remains behind bars on $10,000 bond and her mother is held on $2,500 bond.

'Fake': They pretended to be a friend asking for money for their daughter, claiming that the girl was in hospital with a heart infection after surgery. They asked for $3,000 on the GoFundMe page . 'This happened 2 weeks after Sofia underwent heart surgery to repair a defect that she was born with. This fellow East Cobb family runs their own home-based business.' When shared by KESQ, the page, entitled 'Sofia's Medical and Family Expenses', had raised just $195 but was asking for $3,000. It is not clear how much money the page eventually raised.

Holly Barber, from Manchester, woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains – but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before. But when the 25-year-old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious. She rushed to hospital, where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms, blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs, killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly. She was treated with medication but, incredibly, a year later was dealt another blow – when medics found another melon-sized blockage in her right lung. Holly Barber, 25, was horrified to be told she had 13 blood clots in her lungs as she believed  she was suffering was just a bad hangover. She is pictured before (left) and after her diagnosis (right) Ms Barber began coughing up blood and was having difficulty breathing, so rushed to hospital. It was there doctors diagnosed pulmonary embolisms - blood clots that were blocking the arteries in her lungs . She was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death. She now takes blood-thinning medication to prevent future clots, but the shock of the ordeal has led her to completely changed her lifestyle. She has given up drinking and taken up exercise in an effort to lead the healthiest life possible, and wants to encourage other to do the same. Ms Barber, who has set up her own diet business, said: 'I was so scared when I started coughing up blood, I had no idea what was happening to me but I knew it wasn't a hangover. 'I used to love partying with friends but after suffering from 13 blood clots, I knew I needed to change my ways. 'A terrifying experience like this gives you a brand new outlook and makes you appreciate things so much more, I'm lucky to be alive. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture.' A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. As in Miss Barber's case, it can be life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. But the main symptoms include: . chest pain – a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in . shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually . coughing – this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood . feeling faint, dizzy or passing out . A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'A pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. 'Some blood clots can be life-threatening, for example a large clot in the main artery. 'Sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late.'

A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. As in Miss Barber's case, it can be life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. But the main symptoms include: . chest pain – a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in . shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually . coughing – this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood . feeling faint, dizzy or passing out . A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.'

Holly Barber, from Manchester, woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains – but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before. But when the 25-year-old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious. She rushed to hospital, where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms, blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs, killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly. She was treated with medication but, incredibly, a year later was dealt another blow – when medics found another melon-sized blockage in her right lung. Holly Barber, 25, was horrified to be told she had 13 blood clots in her lungs as she believed  she was suffering was just a bad hangover. She is pictured before (left) and after her diagnosis (right) Ms Barber began coughing up blood and was having difficulty breathing, so rushed to hospital. It was there doctors diagnosed pulmonary embolisms - blood clots that were blocking the arteries in her lungs . She was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death. She now takes blood-thinning medication to prevent future clots, but the shock of the ordeal has led her to completely changed her lifestyle. She has given up drinking and taken up exercise in an effort to lead the healthiest life possible, and wants to encourage other to do the same. Ms Barber, who has set up her own diet business, said: 'I was so scared when I started coughing up blood, I had no idea what was happening to me but I knew it wasn't a hangover. 'I used to love partying with friends but after suffering from 13 blood clots, I knew I needed to change my ways. 'A terrifying experience like this gives you a brand new outlook and makes you appreciate things so much more, I'm lucky to be alive. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture.' A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. As in Miss Barber's case, it can be life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. But the main symptoms include: . chest pain – a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in . shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually . coughing – this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood . feeling faint, dizzy or passing out . A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'A pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. 'Some blood clots can be life-threatening, for example a large clot in the main artery. 'Sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late.'

Dino Maglio, who is on trial in Padua, northern Italy, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Tuesday after the girl reported being drugged and raped while staying at his home. Prosecutors said Maglio spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur the girl was drinking with a tranquilliser pill. Maglio claimed sex with the girl, who was under-age at the time, was consensual but admitted he was 'stupid' to spike her drink. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquilliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Former Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured right) has been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl . Maglio was ordered to pay €60,000 ($83,000) to the victim and €15,000 ($20,000) to her mother, who was travelling with her at the time, the Guardian reports. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO) carried out a year-long investigation into Maglio, collecting 14 testimonies from women who claimed they were assaulted by him after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The policeman was accused of using the name of Leon on Couchsurfing.com. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age . Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The IRPO's investigation revealed a man who made himself seem like a fun and fast-living host. Some alleged victims claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. Dino Maglio's Couchsurfing profile page listed his name as Leon Padova and showed his occupation as a policeman . Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term . She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian.

A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'A pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. 'Some blood clots can be life-threatening, for example a large clot in the main artery. 'Sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late.'

Dino Maglio, who is on trial in Padua, northern Italy, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Tuesday after the girl reported being drugged and raped while staying at his home. Prosecutors said Maglio spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur the girl was drinking with a tranquilliser pill. Maglio claimed sex with the girl, who was under-age at the time, was consensual but admitted he was 'stupid' to spike her drink. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquilliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Former Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured right) has been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl . Maglio was ordered to pay €60,000 ($83,000) to the victim and €15,000 ($20,000) to her mother, who was travelling with her at the time, the Guardian reports. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO) carried out a year-long investigation into Maglio, collecting 14 testimonies from women who claimed they were assaulted by him after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The policeman was accused of using the name of Leon on Couchsurfing.com. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age . Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The IRPO's investigation revealed a man who made himself seem like a fun and fast-living host. Some alleged victims claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself.

Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term . She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe.

Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy .

My husband Harry and I knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time. Our baby girl is due on June 4 and, when we touched down in Dubai, I was 28 weeks pregnant. You can't fly after that without a doctor's note. We had left it until the last minute and, by the time we arrived, both of us were ready to relax. I'd been to Dubai once before as a swimmer, when we stayed in an apartment. This was completely different - and utterly amazing. The Anantara is part of The Palm project and is like nowhere else. Because it has over-the-water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the Maldives, but when we went to the Australian themed restaurant, I imagined I was back in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity — even though there weren't any luxuries in that jungle. You have to see Dubai to believe it. Everything is so clean, luxurious and new — even the main tourist areas. And everywhere hotels are being built. We kept asking ourselves how they will all survive, but somehow they will. Our room was on the lagoon, which meant we had direct access to the water. We tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool, then, after lunch, we retreated to our gorgeous room, where we had sun beds on the balcony. Harry is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies. By 4pm, it gets hazy in Dubai. Some days we went for a wander around the whole resort, which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out. It never felt crowded. Jump in: The Anantara has three turquoise-blue 'lagoons' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels . We had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby. We always wanted to know what to expect — we're having a girl — because we are both impatient people and are keen to plan ahead, but we can't agree on a name. Naming something before you see it is strange and it's vital that her first name goes with her last, which will be Harry's name, Needs. We want a name that won't sound as if she is 'Needy', if you see what I mean. One day, we went out on a boat and I hoped to see David Beckham's house, but no one seemed sure where it was exactly. But what we did see were some of the most expensive properties ever. There's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world. We also made a trip to the famous Dubai Mall, which is bigger than a football stadium — or so it seems. And guess what? We bought our not-born-yet baby her first swimsuit. It has a French look to it, with jaunty stripes. My plan is to take her swimming as soon as I can. It's something we will always be able to do together. Retail therapy: Rebecca Adlington did a spot of shopping at the famous (and enormous) Dubai Mall . More importantly, I regard swimming as a valuable life skill and I was surprised to see at the hotel that some children had never learned.

This was completely different - and utterly amazing. The Anantara is part of The Palm project and is like nowhere else. Because it has over-the-water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the Maldives, but when we went to the Australian themed restaurant, I imagined I was back in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity — even though there weren't any luxuries in that jungle. You have to see Dubai to believe it. Everything is so clean, luxurious and new — even the main tourist areas. And everywhere hotels are being built. We kept asking ourselves how they will all survive, but somehow they will. Our room was on the lagoon, which meant we had direct access to the water. We tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool, then, after lunch, we retreated to our gorgeous room, where we had sun beds on the balcony. Harry is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies. By 4pm, it gets hazy in Dubai. Some days we went for a wander around the whole resort, which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out. It never felt crowded. Jump in: The Anantara has three turquoise-blue 'lagoons' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels . We had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby. We always wanted to know what to expect — we're having a girl — because we are both impatient people and are keen to plan ahead, but we can't agree on a name. Naming something before you see it is strange and it's vital that her first name goes with her last, which will be Harry's name, Needs. We want a name that won't sound as if she is 'Needy', if you see what I mean. One day, we went out on a boat and I hoped to see David Beckham's house, but no one seemed sure where it was exactly. But what we did see were some of the most expensive properties ever. There's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world. We also made a trip to the famous Dubai Mall, which is bigger than a football stadium — or so it seems. And guess what? We bought our not-born-yet baby her first swimsuit. It has a French look to it, with jaunty stripes. My plan is to take her swimming as soon as I can. It's something we will always be able to do together. Retail therapy: Rebecca Adlington did a spot of shopping at the famous (and enormous) Dubai Mall . More importantly, I regard swimming as a valuable life skill and I was surprised to see at the hotel that some children had never learned. That's why I've started Becky Adlington Swim Stars for three to 11-year-olds. Already we have 17 venues taking part and 3,500 children are learning to swim with us. There were lots of British people in the hotel and they were all very friendly. It never bothers me if someone wants to come up and have a chat or have a photograph taken. Athletes are different to film stars in that people see us as we are, not playing a particular role. And we are used to having a microphone shoved in our faces immediately after we have competed. It teaches you to be natural. One thing I enjoyed at The Anantara was looking at all the baby equipment people have. It started to give me ideas. I was also pleased to see how kind everyone was to the children. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. This is a real family resort. Paradise pictured:  The Anantara offers over-the-water villas which provide the perfect sea view . After I retired from competitive swimming at the age of 23, I didn't go near a pool for six months. Then I started to swim again as a way to keep fit and I still love it. I love the feeling of being weightless and this is especially welcome when you're pregnant. Harry and I went to the gym a few times at the hotel and I did a bit of this and that, but I am not used to high-impact sport. A gym is difficult on my knees. There is not the tiniest bit of me that ever wants to compete again. As an athlete, I was so focused and driven and I left the sport knowing that I could not have given more of myself. All that training was really tough, but I chose to do it. Flashback: Rebecca survived daunting trials when she appeared on I'm A Celebrity... in 2013 . Now, I have a chance to get on with the rest of my life and I'm excited about that, too. It gives me an opportunity to try new things — like coming to Dubai with Harry and spending most of the time lying around. In the Australian restaurant, an Arab man came up to me and said he recognised me. 'You'll feel at home in this restaurant, then?' he said. 'Why?' I said. 'I'm not Australian.' 'Because you were on that programme in the jungle,' he said, without mentioning my swimming. I am so pleased to have done I'm A Celebrity. It helped me find my feet and I've always loved Ant and Dec. But it was scary not knowing what would happen and suddenly finding myself with 11 strangers. What's for sure is that it really made me appreciate a holiday like the one in Dubai.

'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute .

There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden.

My husband Harry and I knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time. Our baby girl is due on June 4 and, when we touched down in Dubai, I was 28 weeks pregnant. You can't fly after that without a doctor's note. We had left it until the last minute and, by the time we arrived, both of us were ready to relax. I'd been to Dubai once before as a swimmer, when we stayed in an apartment. This was completely different - and utterly amazing. The Anantara is part of The Palm project and is like nowhere else. Because it has over-the-water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the Maldives, but when we went to the Australian themed restaurant, I imagined I was back in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity — even though there weren't any luxuries in that jungle. You have to see Dubai to believe it. Everything is so clean, luxurious and new — even the main tourist areas. And everywhere hotels are being built. We kept asking ourselves how they will all survive, but somehow they will. Our room was on the lagoon, which meant we had direct access to the water. We tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool, then, after lunch, we retreated to our gorgeous room, where we had sun beds on the balcony. Harry is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies. By 4pm, it gets hazy in Dubai. Some days we went for a wander around the whole resort, which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out. It never felt crowded. Jump in: The Anantara has three turquoise-blue 'lagoons' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels . We had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby. We always wanted to know what to expect — we're having a girl — because we are both impatient people and are keen to plan ahead, but we can't agree on a name. Naming something before you see it is strange and it's vital that her first name goes with her last, which will be Harry's name, Needs. We want a name that won't sound as if she is 'Needy', if you see what I mean. One day, we went out on a boat and I hoped to see David Beckham's house, but no one seemed sure where it was exactly. But what we did see were some of the most expensive properties ever. There's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world. We also made a trip to the famous Dubai Mall, which is bigger than a football stadium — or so it seems. And guess what? We bought our not-born-yet baby her first swimsuit. It has a French look to it, with jaunty stripes. My plan is to take her swimming as soon as I can. It's something we will always be able to do together.

'Disappeared': Chip shop worker Jeannie Flynn, 53, has described the terrifying moment she plunged 10ft underground after a pavement opened up beneath her on a busy southwest London street . Busy street: Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she concerned heard passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse' She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to pick up a prescription when a man told her to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement. As she did so the ground gave way and she plummeted downwards. Speaking to The Sun, she added: 'I fell and I think I screamed. Bricks were falling but didn't hit me. I'm grateful I'm not badly injured.' A worker from the Marrakech Express cafe then came to the rescue opening up their basement and leading her upstairs for a coffee. 'I felt like something stronger! I was really shaky,' she joked. Ms Flynn was taken to a hospital in Fulham and was found to have suffered whiplash and bruising. Her partner Chris Jeffries, 48, claims she could have been killed in the accident. Immediately after the incident, onlookers hearing a loud scream before Ms Flynn 'disappeared' down the gap in the road and landed on the rubble below. Ambulance crews were called to the cafe at about 8.50am to provide medical care. A man takes a picture of the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole that suddenly appeared on Thursday, exposing the cafe's basement below . At the time there was confusion over whether Ms Flynn had been pushing a pram - but this was not the case. Kate Sissons, who witnessed the fall, posted a picture on Instagram, saying: 'OMG! Poor woman and pram just disappeared down this hole on North End Rd. Shes stuck down there. She added: 'Loud scream and all I could see was the pram. Ambulance and fire on way to get her out. Scary. V v scary [sic].' A nearby flower stall owner, who asked not to be named, said she saw a man come running out of the cafe, shortly before the drama unfolded. 'The hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs but she had squeezed through and went straight down,' she said. 'She didn't have a pram or a buggy, it was a shopping trolley. 'The shop owner was shouting out to her ""Don't come through there"". 'We looked over and she was down, all the way down the hole. She had walked onto it and it had collapsed beneath her.' Scotland Yard confirmed that officers attended the scene at 8.42am and that a child had not been involved. Paul Smith, 28, a builder who was walking to work when he saw what he described as a 'shocking' scene. He said: 'Someone had fallen through - just like a trapdoor. It's crazy. There is a huge hole in the floor and someone has fallen through the pavement. 'It is about a metre wide and about eight foot deep. I couldn't see inside to see if it was a man or a woman but it was a person and the police were all around.' Atila Mohammed, who runs the Marrakech Express where the hole opened up in front of in North End Road, said he first became aware of the hole shortly before the incident. He said: 'A young man was passing, he came to me and said ""I was walking along and the pavement has broken"".' Mr Mohammed said that it was while he was checking the man was okay that woman, who was walking quite fast, approached the  hole, which at this point was only quite small. This is the first image that emerged of the incident on Thursday morning, taken by witness Kate Sissons . 'People were outside looking around and everyone said ""Stop, stop, stop"" as she put her foot on the pavement. 'I said ""stop, stop"", but I couldn't stop her. There was only a small hole from the man before, but when the lady stepped there she broke everything and it fell. 'I tried to hold her and she fell all the way down. But she's ok now I held her til the end.' He said he lowered her down the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole and she walked back up to the cafe via the basement and stairs and gave her a coffee while she waited for paramedics to arrive. The cafe manager claims he warned the council about the hole two years ago as he had noticed it was 'sagging'. Mr Mohammed said: 'We were shocked. We told the council nearly two years ago it looks like its sagging and they've done nothing.' Passers-by stop to take a look at the eight foot deep hole, which has been cordoned off since the incident . A cafe regular, who asked not to be named said: 'When we arrived about 9.10 all the police were here. 'We sit here every day and we were told that there was a large hole in the road and that the lady was running along the road, rushing.' The 76-year-old added: 'The cafe manager came out and grabbed her. She had a green coat and blue/black trousers, I heard. 'I thought the woman who told me was joking, but having said that there has been a big droop in that area of pavement for a long long time. I noticed it away back in February. 'I see elderly people pushing shopping trolleys along here - it could have been them we were all shocked it was an accident waiting to happen.' Laura Hill, 30, who lives in Wimbledon but works as a nanny in the area, walks up and down the road 'at least 10 times a day' and says it could have happened to anyone. 'It's an uneven pavement and a very busy area, with a bus stop really nearby. Lots of elderly people sit outside that cafe in the morning too. 'I walk up and down the street at least 10 times a day with the child I look after in a pushchair. When I heard I thought ""that could've been me"". 'It's all been boarded up now and you have to walk on the road to get past the hole now. People have been stopping to take pictures of it all day.' A London Ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics were called to the scene at 8.53am after found the patient was 'shaken but not seriously injured' and took her to Charing Cross Hospital. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that Mr Mohammed raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council's structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what's happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.' She also said that the incident had not been captured on CCTV. Exposed: The basement door of the century old cellar at the Marrakech Express can be seen below .

There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'",Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball after Inverness's win. Inverness were down to 10 men when Craig Gordon was sent off. John Hughes says the break could have meant a penalty and red card. Hughes says Celtic will go on and win the Scottish Cup with win.,t5_nlpo_on_supervised

One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.'

Busy street: Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she concerned heard passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse' She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to pick up a prescription when a man told her to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement. As she did so the ground gave way and she plummeted downwards. Speaking to The Sun, she added: 'I fell and I think I screamed. Bricks were falling but didn't hit me. I'm grateful I'm not badly injured.' A worker from the Marrakech Express cafe then came to the rescue opening up their basement and leading her upstairs for a coffee. 'I felt like something stronger! I was really shaky,' she joked. Ms Flynn was taken to a hospital in Fulham and was found to have suffered whiplash and bruising. Her partner Chris Jeffries, 48, claims she could have been killed in the accident. Immediately after the incident, onlookers hearing a loud scream before Ms Flynn 'disappeared' down the gap in the road and landed on the rubble below.

'The hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs but she had squeezed through and went straight down,' she said. 'She didn't have a pram or a buggy, it was a shopping trolley. 'The shop owner was shouting out to her ""Don't come through there"". 'We looked over and she was down, all the way down the hole. She had walked onto it and it had collapsed beneath her.' Scotland Yard confirmed that officers attended the scene at 8.42am and that a child had not been involved.

Desperate migrants pictured in the sea off the Greek island Rhodes after a wooden boat ran aground . The discovery comes after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. EU leaders have now agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating crisis in the Mediterranean. A Syrian sailor, who is said to go by the name Abu Moaz, has been using a closed Facebook page to sell  crossings to Greece after finding himself short of work, according to the Financial Times. 'It is people smuggling, no more and no less,' he told the newspaper. Others are said to be offering  refugees voyages to Italy and Turkey from the notorious smuggling port of Zuwara in Libya. This week the victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried  in Malta . Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. Facebook has reportedly said it has removed the pages, according to the Financial Times.

The actor bought the Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet in 1962, shortly after winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Batiatus in Spartacus. It was one of the most luxurious cars of its day, costing £4,000 and was delivered to him at a Swiss hotel at a time when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500. The Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet once belonged to actor Peter Ustinov and is expected to fetch £1million when it goes up for auction at Bonhams. That's more than twice what it cost just four years ago .

The fast lane: The car cost £4,000 in 1962 when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500 . Quick sale: The 3.7-litre engine produced 240bhp. It went 0-60mph in nine seconds and had a top speed of 140mph. This was one of the fastest cars of the era so attracted interest from the rich and famous . Listed: The car is expected to attract £1million - more than double the £431,200 it sold for four years ago . And while the average UK home is now £177,000, the value of Ustinov's Aston has rocketed even more and is expected to sell for around £1 million next month. This is £570,000 MORE than the price paid for the Aston Martin when it was sold at a London auction in 2011. Engineers had fitted the car with a 3.7-litre engine developing around 240bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of nine seconds and a top speed of 140mph.

The actor bought the Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet in 1962, shortly after winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Batiatus in Spartacus. It was one of the most luxurious cars of its day, costing £4,000 and was delivered to him at a Swiss hotel at a time when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500. The Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet once belonged to actor Peter Ustinov and is expected to fetch £1million when it goes up for auction at Bonhams. That's more than twice what it cost just four years ago . A collectors piece: These pictures show the prestigious Aston Martin logo on the bonnet, left, a trademark of the elite brand, and an absolutely spotless stylish leather trim, left, that once seated Peter Ustinov . The fast lane: The car cost £4,000 in 1962 when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500 . Quick sale: The 3.7-litre engine produced 240bhp. It went 0-60mph in nine seconds and had a top speed of 140mph. This was one of the fastest cars of the era so attracted interest from the rich and famous . Listed: The car is expected to attract £1million - more than double the £431,200 it sold for four years ago . And while the average UK home is now £177,000, the value of Ustinov's Aston has rocketed even more and is expected to sell for around £1 million next month. This is £570,000 MORE than the price paid for the Aston Martin when it was sold at a London auction in 2011. Engineers had fitted the car with a 3.7-litre engine developing around 240bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of nine seconds and a top speed of 140mph. Perfect form: The DB4 was considered one of the most beautiful and luxurious cars of its day .

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson takes a look at the Spain under 21 defender. Why are English clubs so keen? His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m. When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you're saying he can't defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates' mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool's Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He's not just an overlapper, he's very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia's academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He's 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however. Marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play? A club like Arsenal could come in and promise far more first-team football which might sway him but Madrid are favourites. Gaya, pictured here at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup, has represented Spain up to under 21 standard . Gaya (left) talks to team-mate Federico Vico during an under 19 international against Germany .

When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you're saying he can't defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates' mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool's Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He's not just an overlapper, he's very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia's academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He's 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however.

Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to £100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate.

Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an 'official meeting' last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: 'The DPP's travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.' The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter.

Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to £100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public . Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice . Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an 'official meeting' last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: 'The DPP's travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.' The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter. MailOnline revealed yesterday that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year.

His celebration? 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect.' Born in Nigeria, Harold and his parents moved to the US when he was eight. He is now a straight A student, with an SAT score of 2270, at Elmont Memorial High School in Long Island, New York, where he has served as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations.

A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public . Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice . Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an 'official meeting' last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: 'The DPP's travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.' The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter. MailOnline revealed yesterday that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year. Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial.

The 18-year-old Long Islander has waited anxiously for weeks since sending off his college applications. But  he didn't expect this.

I couldn't believe it,' Harold told DailyMail.com as he recounted the five minutes when acceptance emails came in from Yale, Harvard, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. His celebration? 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect.' Born in Nigeria, Harold and his parents moved to the US when he was eight. He is now a straight A student, with an SAT score of 2270, at Elmont Memorial High School in Long Island, New York, where he has served as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations.

Speaking to DailyMail.com, Harold admitted he has set a high bar for his four younger brothers (pictured) 'Sky isn't the limit': Harold, pictured aged 13, three years after arriving in the U.S., told his brothers (pictured) that they will surpass his accomplishments. 'People say the sky is the limit - it won't be for them,' he said . He told DailyMail.com: 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. 'They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity.

His achievement has been hailed as the American Dream, but Harold downplays it. 'I just worked hard and took every opportunity that was afforded to me. 'I came over with a very heavy Nigerian accent, but I did everything I could to integrate. Learning American history was really hard but I was determined to tackle it so I signed up for AP History as a junior.' With four younger brothers, he has set the bar high.

'When I got the news, I told them they can achieve anything. I said people say the sky is the limit but they can go even further than that. I know they will.' Ultimately, he plans to be a neurosurgeon to study Alzheimer's, a disease his grandmother suffers from. But insists he won't just be studying.

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I've ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys – it's what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour', come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don't have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot's Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you'll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You'll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I'm sure I'd be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery – you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don't neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you've made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

The 18-year-old Long Islander has waited anxiously for weeks since sending off his college applications. But  he didn't expect this. Harold has been accepted by every single one - including all eight Ivy League schools. It comes a year after another high schooler from Long Island, Kwasi Enin, was met with the same news. He chose Yale. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Whiz kid: Meet Harold Ekeh, the Long Island senior who has been accepted to every Ivy League college . Incredible achievement: Harold, 18, insists he had no idea he would be accepted by all 13 colleges . Star: The high school senior moved from Nigeria to Long Island 10 years ago with his parents Roseline (pictured) and Paul Ekeh. He says his parents' struggle inspired him to take every opportunity he was afforded . 'It was crazy. My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it,' Harold told DailyMail.com as he recounted the five minutes when acceptance emails came in from Yale, Harvard, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. His celebration? 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect.' Born in Nigeria, Harold and his parents moved to the US when he was eight. He is now a straight A student, with an SAT score of 2270, at Elmont Memorial High School in Long Island, New York, where he has served as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. His success, he explains, is down to the submission essay, in which he described his family's struggle to fit in after emigrating to America. It was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. His story: Harold says his winning essay described the struggle of  fitting in after emigrating to America . Speaking to DailyMail.com, Harold admitted he has set a high bar for his four younger brothers (pictured) 'Sky isn't the limit': Harold, pictured aged 13, three years after arriving in the U.S., told his brothers (pictured) that they will surpass his accomplishments. 'People say the sky is the limit - it won't be for them,' he said . He told DailyMail.com: 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. 'They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' His achievement has been hailed as the American Dream, but Harold downplays it. 'I just worked hard and took every opportunity that was afforded to me. 'I came over with a very heavy Nigerian accent, but I did everything I could to integrate. Learning American history was really hard but I was determined to tackle it so I signed up for AP History as a junior.' With four younger brothers, he has set the bar high. He doesn't think that'll be a problem, however. 'They are going to beat my accomplishments. They were very excited by the news, they look up to me and follow my lead. 'When I got the news, I told them they can achieve anything. I said people say the sky is the limit but they can go even further than that. I know they will.' Ultimately, he plans to be a neurosurgeon to study Alzheimer's, a disease his grandmother suffers from. But insists he won't just be studying. 'I'm torn because each school offers something different, and there are so many different things I'm looking for,' he said. 'I want to go to a good school where I can study hard, but I also want somewhere where I feel comfortable; somewhere I could imagine calling home. 'I also want to meet other students, make friends, travel, and do other activities. 'When people ask me which one, I have said Yale so far because I have a connection with Yale. I went to Yale with the Model United Nations, and got to see how inspiring and interesting it is there. 'I'm visiting a few this month and will decide at the end.'

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I've ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys – it's what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour', come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don't have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot's Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you'll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You'll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I'm sure I'd be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery – you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don't neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you've made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

All of the 36 units at the Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an 'eyesore' by local residents. But the local council defended the colour scheme, claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home. Graham White, 76, from Penarth said the changes to the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme' The 36 homes as they were before the council spent £750,000 including funds from the Intermediate Care Fund on the renovation . One pensioner, Graham White, 76, said residents think the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'. Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here. 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' The residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'. She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.' However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'. She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.' Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'. Mr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' She said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it. 'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.' She said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting. She said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.' Not impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years .",the 36 properties at the redlands house sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment. local council has defended the colour scheme saying it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home. one pensioner said the property looks'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation',t5_zeroshot

All of the 36 units at the Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an 'eyesore' by local residents. But the local council defended the colour scheme, claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home.

One pensioner, Graham White, 76, said residents think the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'. Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here. 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' The residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'. She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.' However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'. She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.' Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'.

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I've ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys – it's what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour', come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don't have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot's Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you'll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You'll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I'm sure I'd be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery – you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on!

Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013. Hundreds of police and soldiers, as well as civilians, have been killed in militant attacks in the past months. Ian Lee reported from Cairo.

Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here. 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' The residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'. She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.' However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'. She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.' Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'. Mr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' She said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it. 'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.' She said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting. She said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.' Not impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years .","Locals say the bizarre refurbishment is more suitable for a playground .Vale of Glamorgan Council paid £750,000 for the unusual renovation .One resident living near the Penarth home called it an eyesore .Council claims colour scheme will help elderly residents with dementia .An earlier version of this article stated the Welsh government contributed £500,000 to the 'Legoland' makeover of sheltered accommodation in Penarth. We have been asked to clarify that their funding was in fact support services for the residences.",references

Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013.

A runaway cat turned up 128 miles from his home after apparently hitching a ride in a caravan. George was last seen running off in the direction of a caravan park near his home in North Wales and was found on a doorstep in West Yorkshire five weeks later. He has now been reunited with his owners after Julia Hill, who found the 18-year-old tabby outside her home in Calderdale last week, posted on a lost and found cats Facebook group. Owners Steven Davison, 71, and his wife Susan, 68, from Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley, couldn't believe their luck when their daughter Gemma Davison-Lemalle, 30, saw a picture of her childhood pet on the page. Mrs Davison-Lemalle said: 'It's a miracle. Around a month ago, my dad drove to the garage in Llanrwst and as he got out of the car, he thought he saw a cat running off in the corner of his eye. 'At the time he thought nothing of it and didn't say anything but when we got home that afternoon George was nowhere to be seen. 'We think George must have sneaked into the car and ran towards the caravan site that is nearby. 'We can't think of any other way of him getting to Yorkshire other than stowing away in a vehicle or caravan belonging to a tourist. 'It's absolutely bonkers to think he travelled so far. We won't be letting him out of our sight ever again.' She revealed her pet had been was rescued from the Bryn-y-Maen animal shelter in Colwyn Bay when he was a kitten and was living with her parents when he disappeared. Her mother, Susan, said: 'Goodness only knows how he got that far - he's always been a curious cat but he's never done anything like this before. He has now been reunited with owners Steven Davison and his wife Susan (pictured together with George) 'We thought we'd lost him for good so it's amazing to have him back. We're over the moon.' But the mammoth cross-country journey took its toll on the 18-year-old cat and when the family went to collect him they realised he had cat flu. 'When we got there we realised he wasn't very well. He had cat flu,' said Gemma. 'He's back where he belongs and he is happy and settled.' Ms Hill, who found George and started the appeal, said the cat was 'poorly, thin and grumpy' when he turned up on her doorstep. 'The cat just turned up outside my house last week,' she said.

A grandfather accused of murdering his baby granddaughter complained she was a 'bloody nightmare' when he looked after her the day before she was rushed to hospital, a court heard. Mark Jones is accused of killing 41-day-old Amelia Rose Jones at his daughter's terraced home in Pontnewydd, south east Wales. The youngster died of a bleed to the brain after being rushed to hospital on the evening she was being babysat by her grandfather. Miss Jones, 25, told Newport Crown Court that after she had left her baby in the care of her father for the first time on November 16 to go on an evening out with her friends she returned home and he said he had had a difficult night with the child. She said: 'When I came home he told me Amelia had been a bloody nightmare ... I didn't think anything of it at the time. 'I trusted him with my life and my children. I had no reason not to. He was my father.' Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murder. His defence is he dropped Amelia on two separate nights - first after accidentally slipping on a toy and then after suddenly fainting. But his daughter claims he never mentioned slipping over when she returned on November 16. The next day the child was being looked after by her grandfather while her mother went to the cinema. Before she returned, Jones made a 999 call saying he had gone to make a cup of coffee but came back to find the baby having difficulty breathing. She was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where medics managed to restore her pulse. But after failing to get her breathing the baby was quickly transferred for specialist treatment at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. She could not be brought back to consciousness and had suffered injuries to her brain, and died on November 19. It is the prosecution's case a possible motive for the killing was the defendant's strong dislike of Amelia's father Ian Skillern, who had finished his relationship with Miss Jones before the birth of their child. The jury has already heard Jones and Mr Skillern could not be in the same room with each other. Miss Jones told the court that on November 14 - days before her daughter's death - her father had made a strange comment about her baby. She said: 'Just as he was leaving he said 'even though I don't like her father I don't hold grudges against a baby'. It was a really strange thing to say and came out of the blue.' Mark Jones, 45, is being tried before a jury at Newport Crown Court after denying his granddaughter's murder . Sarah also recalled an incident where she had left Amelia with her father during a shopping trip - and upon her return she found the baby screaming 'like never before'. She told the court Jones blamed the crying fit on another child - something which she said she had no reason to doubt at the time. Miss Jones also revealed how her father - who had little to do with her as a child until she was 16 - previously duped her into thinking he was gravely ill and even posed as a doctor in bogus phone calls as he tried to mend their broken relationship. Amelia was rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after her grandfather dialled emergency services . The jury has also been told Jones, of Cwmbran in south east Wales, admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice after lying to police about a teenage boy accidentally hurting Amelia. Prosecution counsel Paul Lewis said the defendant's 'detailed and calculated lies' demonstrated the lengths Jones was prepared to go to 'to try and conceal the truth about Amelia's injuries'.

A grandfather accused of murdering his baby granddaughter complained she was a 'bloody nightmare' when he looked after her the day before she was rushed to hospital, a court heard. Mark Jones is accused of killing 41-day-old Amelia Rose Jones at his daughter's terraced home in Pontnewydd, south east Wales. The youngster died of a bleed to the brain after being rushed to hospital on the evening she was being babysat by her grandfather. Miss Jones, 25, told Newport Crown Court that after she had left her baby in the care of her father for the first time on November 16 to go on an evening out with her friends she returned home and he said he had had a difficult night with the child. She said: 'When I came home he told me Amelia had been a bloody nightmare ... I didn't think anything of it at the time. 'I trusted him with my life and my children. I had no reason not to. He was my father.' Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murder. His defence is he dropped Amelia on two separate nights - first after accidentally slipping on a toy and then after suddenly fainting. But his daughter claims he never mentioned slipping over when she returned on November 16. The next day the child was being looked after by her grandfather while her mother went to the cinema. Before she returned, Jones made a 999 call saying he had gone to make a cup of coffee but came back to find the baby having difficulty breathing. She was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where medics managed to restore her pulse. But after failing to get her breathing the baby was quickly transferred for specialist treatment at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. She could not be brought back to consciousness and had suffered injuries to her brain, and died on November 19. It is the prosecution's case a possible motive for the killing was the defendant's strong dislike of Amelia's father Ian Skillern, who had finished his relationship with Miss Jones before the birth of their child. The jury has already heard Jones and Mr Skillern could not be in the same room with each other. Miss Jones told the court that on November 14 - days before her daughter's death - her father had made a strange comment about her baby. She said: 'Just as he was leaving he said 'even though I don't like her father I don't hold grudges against a baby'. It was a really strange thing to say and came out of the blue.' Mark Jones, 45, is being tried before a jury at Newport Crown Court after denying his granddaughter's murder . Sarah also recalled an incident where she had left Amelia with her father during a shopping trip - and upon her return she found the baby screaming 'like never before'. She told the court Jones blamed the crying fit on another child - something which she said she had no reason to doubt at the time. Miss Jones also revealed how her father - who had little to do with her as a child until she was 16 - previously duped her into thinking he was gravely ill and even posed as a doctor in bogus phone calls as he tried to mend their broken relationship. Amelia was rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after her grandfather dialled emergency services . The jury has also been told Jones, of Cwmbran in south east Wales, admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice after lying to police about a teenage boy accidentally hurting Amelia. Prosecution counsel Paul Lewis said the defendant's 'detailed and calculated lies' demonstrated the lengths Jones was prepared to go to 'to try and conceal the truth about Amelia's injuries'. High Court judge Wyn Williams said he expects the trial to go on until the end of April. The case continues.

The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today.

Baltimore police have come under intense scrutiny after Gray was taken into custody and suffered an unexplained spinal injury that led to his death. Six officers have been suspended with pay as local police and federal authorities investigate. However, commissioner Anthony Batts has ruled out the possibility of his resignation. Scroll down for video . 'That's not going to happen': Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts ruled out his resignation despite that fact that his deputy admitted they should have sought medical attention for Freddie Gray . Batts addressed a news conference in Baltimore on Friday amid growing calls for him to step down . Concession: Police admit they should have sought medical help for Freddie Gray (pictured being detained on April 12) when he requested assistance in the police car. He was later pronounced dead . Commissioner Batts said the investigation is being refined and the picture is getting 'sharper and sharper.' He did not elaborate. As for calls for his resignation, he said: 'That's not going to happen.' Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray died on Sunday, April 19, after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' while in police custody . Gray was not buckled in by a seat belt, a violation of the police department's policy. He asked for medical help several times, and after a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. At some point - either during his arrest or inside the van - he suffered a mysterious spinal injury. Authorities have not explained how or when it occurred. Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis said Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot of his arrest. Bystander video shows Gray screaming as officers carried him to the van, his legs appearing limp. After a week of protests, people angry over the death promised their biggest march Saturday, when they would try to 'shut down' the city. The demonstrators say Gray's death shows police mistreatment of blacks in Baltimore and throughout the country. The mayor thanked protesters for being peaceful so far. She expects the results of the investigation to be turned over to prosecutors in a week, and they will decide whether any criminal charges will be filed. 'I will not deny we have had a very long and complicated history on issues such as these,' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said. 'But it's important to remember that we have an equally long history of peaceful and legal protest.' Asked if Gray's possible 'rough ride' is a one-off, the mayor said: 'It's clearly not a one-off. The reason we have the policy around seat belts in the police vans is because of an incident that happened previously,' referring to Dondi Johnson. He died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt, with his hands cuffed behind his back. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake speaks in front of local faith leaders at a news conference regarding the death of Freddie Gray on Friday. She appeared to support the police with her statements . Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department exchanges words with young demonstrators . More than 50 officers manned a barricade surrounding the station, separating them from the protesters . Protesters for Freddie Gray stand outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. The protest was peaceful, though some in the crowd hurled insults at the officers behind the fence, who stared back stone-faced . Angela Hazel (C) reacts near City Hall during a protest against the death of Freddie Gray Hazel said 'I lost my child to the streets, too. My only child...' The leader of a group of local ministers called on Batts to resign immediately. 'It seems that no one in the police department can explain what happened,' said the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore. He said the police department is 'in disarray' and Batts has shown a 'lack of viable leadership capabilities.' The mayor appeared to back the police commissioner at her own news conference. 'Nickel rides' have caused spinal injuries in the past and Baltimore police epartment rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device . The president of a black lawyers' group predicted thousands of people would turn out Saturday, when good weather is forecast and the Orioles are hosting the Boston Red Sox in a Major League Baseball game. 'Things will change on Saturday, and the struggle will be amplified,' said Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. Shabazz rejected the notion that he was an outside agitator who would stir up trouble. Bernard Young, Baltimore City Council president said prior to a rally on Thursday that he hoped citizens wouldn't let 'outside forces come in here and dictate how we act by destroying our infrastructure.' 'We can lead ourselves. We're capable of doing that,' he said.","Freddie Gray, who is black, asked for medical help but was denied during 30-minute police car ride, eventually paramedics were called .Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis conceded their failure .But chief commissioner refuses to resign over the death .Six officers are suspended without pay during an investigation .",references

The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.'

However, unlike most app developers, he learnt about technology not at MIT or at Stanford, but at San Quentin Correctional Facility. He is the first graduate of The Last Mile, the world's only prison-based tech incubator. Unprecedented: This is Kenyatta Leal, the first graduate of San Quentin's tech program that teaches prisoners who have never experienced the internet how to code and build a business for when they are paroled . Leal was one of 15 prisoners who was selected from about 200 to undergo six months of intensive business training with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to develop their own business plan - while inside San Quentin. MC Hammer acted as one of his numerous mentors. Each prisoner that applies to the scheme must complete an application process, as they would for a job, explaining their history and their ambitions, plus one 'essay question' about their life. Leal was handed a life sentence in 1994 for his third strike, unlawfully possessing a firearm after committing a felony. He was locked up in the country's oldest men's prison, which has housed Charles Manson and Bobby Kennedy killer Sirhan Sirhan. But in 2011 he was handed a lifeline: programming. The business program teaches inmates about the internet, a phenomenon invented in the mid-90s after most of them were incarcerated. The aim is for each to develop a business idea to embark on after their release as most struggle to find work 'on the outside'. Now, after being paroled in 2013, Leal is lobbying investors to back the unprecedented method of criminal rehabilitation: teaching cons about technology. 'I've been very lucky,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I was completely lost when I was incarcerated. I didn't know what I was doing. 'Then I started hearing about this thing called the internet. My family started visiting me with these things called smart phones, we would talk about 'the internet' inside. 'I was asking, ""What is 'tweeting'? What is a 'blog'? What is 'Google'?"" I wanted to know more.' The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz and his wife Beverly Parenti, who were asked to perform a half-hour guest speech to prisoners. But, intrigued by the questions they were asked, they stayed for hours and as they left, vowed to come back. California has a 61 per cent rate of re-offending within the first years - the highest of any state. And criminals cost $47,000 a year. Kenyatta Leal became a star of his class by developing a live version of Fantasy Football called Coach Potato - which will launch after he completes his second degree in business management. Chris Schuhmacher, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death a friend that stole a suitcase of marijuana from his apartment 12 years ago, is another star student, now developing a fitness app. Horatio Herts, is currently in Pittsburgh advising state legislators on how to tackle obesity. His business plan was called The Healthy Hearts Foundation. It focuses on ways to help overweight Americans get back in shape. James Houston has built a curriculum to teach under-privileged, inner-city children about technology. As Americans struggle to land jobs, and employers place an increased emphasis on computer literacy, prisoners who have never even seen a computer are sidelined from any tech-related occupations.

Chris Schuhmacher, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death a friend that stole a suitcase of marijuana from his apartment 12 years ago, is another star student, now developing a fitness app. Like Leal, Shuhmacher completed an Associate Arts degree at Patten University during his time inside, and graduated as valedictorian of his class.

It focuses on ways to help overweight Americans get back in shape. James Houston has built a curriculum to teach under-privileged, inner-city children about technology. Leal said: 'Men in prison, they have an entrepreneurial spirit but it's misdirected. 'If you start inside it carries on to the outside. I felt like I was on the sidelines and needed a way to start over.' Since technology and the internet are banned in prison, The Last Mile has developed dummy programs that mimic websites such as Twitter, Word Press and Google. The guard tower at San Quentin State Prison, where the program is based. The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz, who was asked to give a half-hour guest speech to prisoners. But, intrigued by the questions he was asked, he stayed for hours . Overlooking: An ex-con and relative cast a glance at San Quentin prison as they  hike in San Francisco . The program has inevitably been a cause for criticism. But none that the prisoners take seriously, they say. 'You do get a few snarky remarks but that comes with the territory because not everybpdy is going to understand what we're bringing to the table. 'Those are the people we want to talk to.' It seems investors agree. Eric Greenberg, author of Generation We who attends The Last Mile's pitch day, even says the so-called graduates have an edge over others pitching. 'Someone who comes through this is a highly inspirational human being who has a lot of things to share,' he explains. As the program grows, and sights are set on Falsom Prison for a Last Mile project, it has drawn attention. Award-winning director Ondi Timoner has just completed a documentary on the program, in connection with Wired, which premiered at SXSW Festival in Austin on March 15. San Quentin is the country's oldest men's prison, which has housed Charles Manson and  Sirhan Sirhan . As the program grows, sights are set on Falsom Prison for a Last Mile project . Timoner, who has directed documentaries one women's prisons and on technology, told DailyMail.com: 'We have a prison system that's just broken. We have the most people incarcerated in the world. 'We need to do something. And imagine the untapped potential in prisons. Criminal behavior and entrepreneurial behavior have a lot of things in common. Entrepreneurs are looking to get things done and quickly and get to the bottom line. Criminals do as well. 'I realized the power of the internet and the democratization that it allows… They can start businesses that are socially good.' Executive producer Rachel Samuels remarks: 'I think this is a new step.

They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group's top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fiancé Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton .

However, unlike most app developers, he learnt about technology not at MIT or at Stanford, but at San Quentin Correctional Facility. He is the first graduate of The Last Mile, the world's only prison-based tech incubator. Unprecedented: This is Kenyatta Leal, the first graduate of San Quentin's tech program that teaches prisoners who have never experienced the internet how to code and build a business for when they are paroled . Leal was one of 15 prisoners who was selected from about 200 to undergo six months of intensive business training with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to develop their own business plan - while inside San Quentin. MC Hammer acted as one of his numerous mentors. Each prisoner that applies to the scheme must complete an application process, as they would for a job, explaining their history and their ambitions, plus one 'essay question' about their life. Leal was handed a life sentence in 1994 for his third strike, unlawfully possessing a firearm after committing a felony. He was locked up in the country's oldest men's prison, which has housed Charles Manson and Bobby Kennedy killer Sirhan Sirhan. But in 2011 he was handed a lifeline: programming. The business program teaches inmates about the internet, a phenomenon invented in the mid-90s after most of them were incarcerated. The aim is for each to develop a business idea to embark on after their release as most struggle to find work 'on the outside'. Now, after being paroled in 2013, Leal is lobbying investors to back the unprecedented method of criminal rehabilitation: teaching cons about technology. 'I've been very lucky,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I was completely lost when I was incarcerated. I didn't know what I was doing. 'Then I started hearing about this thing called the internet. My family started visiting me with these things called smart phones, we would talk about 'the internet' inside. 'I was asking, ""What is 'tweeting'? What is a 'blog'? What is 'Google'?"" I wanted to know more.' The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz and his wife Beverly Parenti, who were asked to perform a half-hour guest speech to prisoners. But, intrigued by the questions they were asked, they stayed for hours and as they left, vowed to come back. California has a 61 per cent rate of re-offending within the first years - the highest of any state. And criminals cost $47,000 a year.

James Houston has built a curriculum to teach under-privileged, inner-city children about technology.

The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns.

However, unlike most app developers, he learnt about technology not at MIT or at Stanford, but at San Quentin Correctional Facility. He is the first graduate of The Last Mile, the world's only prison-based tech incubator. Unprecedented: This is Kenyatta Leal, the first graduate of San Quentin's tech program that teaches prisoners who have never experienced the internet how to code and build a business for when they are paroled . Leal was one of 15 prisoners who was selected from about 200 to undergo six months of intensive business training with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to develop their own business plan - while inside San Quentin. MC Hammer acted as one of his numerous mentors. Each prisoner that applies to the scheme must complete an application process, as they would for a job, explaining their history and their ambitions, plus one 'essay question' about their life. Leal was handed a life sentence in 1994 for his third strike, unlawfully possessing a firearm after committing a felony. He was locked up in the country's oldest men's prison, which has housed Charles Manson and Bobby Kennedy killer Sirhan Sirhan. But in 2011 he was handed a lifeline: programming. The business program teaches inmates about the internet, a phenomenon invented in the mid-90s after most of them were incarcerated. The aim is for each to develop a business idea to embark on after their release as most struggle to find work 'on the outside'. Now, after being paroled in 2013, Leal is lobbying investors to back the unprecedented method of criminal rehabilitation: teaching cons about technology. 'I've been very lucky,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I was completely lost when I was incarcerated. I didn't know what I was doing. 'Then I started hearing about this thing called the internet. My family started visiting me with these things called smart phones, we would talk about 'the internet' inside. 'I was asking, ""What is 'tweeting'? What is a 'blog'? What is 'Google'?"" I wanted to know more.' The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz and his wife Beverly Parenti, who were asked to perform a half-hour guest speech to prisoners. But, intrigued by the questions they were asked, they stayed for hours and as they left, vowed to come back. California has a 61 per cent rate of re-offending within the first years - the highest of any state. And criminals cost $47,000 a year.

Julie Stauch and married couple Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy all appear in on the video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group's top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said.

Julie Stauch and married couple Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy all appear in on the video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with Martin O'Malley's people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group's top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fiancé Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton . Milrad, who is a lawyer and social campaigner, worked for Obama in New Hampshire during his 2008 White House bid . The couple pictured at the White House. They have been active campaigners in Democrat campaigns and plan to donate financially to Clinton's White House bid .","Julie Stauch and Sean Bagniewski all appear on Hillary Clinton's 2016 video.

Andrei Lunev reportedly walked on a tripwire while reporting on recent fighting in Shyrokyne, a village near Mariupol in East Ukraine, and suffered serious head and lower extremities wounds. Mr Lunev, reportedly from Donetsk, Ukraine, received first aid at the scene by medics and visibly shaken colleagues, before he was taken to hospital. Scroll down for video . A OSCE medic provides first aid Andrei Lunev, a reporter for a Russian television channel, after he stepped on a landmine trip wire in Shirokine near Mariupol while covering the conflict in East Ukraine . Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling and changed hands repeatedly throughout the conflict, with a small group of journalists. Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier. The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine's once industrial heartland in ruins. Casualty: Mr Lunev, reportedly from Donetsk, Ukraine, received first aid at the scene by medics and his visibly shaken colleagues, before he was taken to a hospital near the Russian border . Run for cover: A group of reporters take cover while medics provide first aid to Mr Luneov, a journalist working for the Russian TV station Zvezda . Aid: Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of the village of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling, with a small group of journalists . Fighting in the east had largely subsided following a cease-fire deal signed in February but has rekindled in recent days. Recovering: Reporter Mr Lunev was taken to hospital where he later regained consciousness . Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period, while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes. The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed. Lysenko also reported civilian casualties, including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area, north of Donetsk. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky. The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin, spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday, but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting. 'The Russian-backed separatists continue to take aggressive action in Ukraine,' she said. 'And the Russian-backed separatists continue to stall Minsk implementation.","Andrei Lunev walked on tripwire while reporting on recent fighting. stepped on landmine while inspecting ruins of village near Mariupol. suffered serious head and lower extremities wounds. was taken to hospital near the Russian border, where he regained consciousness. fighting in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 6,000 lives.",t5_zeroshot

I've always had a love affair with Thailand. At the end of filming Channel 4's Indian Summers last year, I headed to Koh Phangan, an island off Ko Samui, and did a week-long meditation and yoga course. I came away convinced I was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in London – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on London Underground and from Sunday hangovers. So I jumped at the chance of heading out to Thailand again before the start of filming series two. Despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless Singapore Airlines, I arrived in Phuket still excited about recapturing my zen. Phuket, however, is very different from Koh Phangan. First of all it is much greener, and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones. I was staying at the luxurious Sri Panwa resort, which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out Enya, and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering Andaman Sea. Villa co-ordinator Pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort (a Thai princess and Liam from One Direction were there). I'm sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel's beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace, but when Pim dropped me off at my villa, she revealed that another famous Sri Panwa guest – DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) – was performing at a nightclub called Seduction that evening. I decided zen could wait. Seduction turned out to be off Bangla Road, the heart of Phuket's red-light district. Having grabbed a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel (complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out Taylor Swift's Blank Space), I arrived at Patong Beach itself. This is the strip is where zen goes to die. Olivia did yoga at Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa (pictured) Bangla Road in Phuket comes to life when the sun goes down. The road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights, loud music and cheap beer . There are Thai versions of cabaret clubs such as Crazy Horse and Moulin Rouge, while street hawkers sold tickets to 'ping-pong shows', which I later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded. Pim ushered me up an escalator to Seduction's rooftop party venue. Norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good-looking Thai crowd, all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an MA at Central Saint Martins in London, into a frenzy. The odd British tourist was in there too, looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below. The wife of one of the owners of Sri Panwa turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was 'VVIP'. Content in this knowledge, I continued my very English head-bob to Norman's hit song Praise You. The next morning, breakfast at Baba, Sri Panwa's poolside restaurant, was a glorious affair. I faced my greatest challenge so far… selecting from the breakfast buffet. Room with a view! The luxurious Sri Panwa resort in Phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the Andaman Sea . I always get a bit nervous at buffets. It has to be a carefully managed procedure, and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice, I did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a Thai fish curry. Curious but excellent is the only way I can describe this combination. It is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there. I caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that I can't really imagine at a breakfast buffet in London. I whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool, slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity, as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless I want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn. The James Bond Island is a popular feature in Phang Nga Bay, Phuket . I then headed up to Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa. Our Thai yoga instructor, who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany, performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from Couples Retreat, for anyone who knows that film. He didn't quite slap me on the bottom and say 'Encouragement', but it was a close-run thing. Then, after a fabulous dinner at Sri Panwa's beautifully appointed Thai restaurant Soul Food, where the 'squid on hot plate' sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for, I submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid. Returning to my quest for zen the next morning, I headed north of Phuket and took a 30-minute boat ride to a quiet island in Phang Nga Bay, which I had been advised was much less touristy than the Phi Phi islands made famous by the film adaptation of Alex Garland's The Beach. I was picked up by the staff of the Six Senses Yao Noi hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier, and was driven to the complex by a tuk-tuk, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in Phuket. DJ Hardwell also known as Fat Boy Slim,  performs a set. The DJ also stayed at the Sri Panwa and performed at a nightclub called seduction . The hotel is much more of a retreat than Sri Panwa and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly, sustainable resort. The landscaped gardens are supposedly 'edible', there's a space for some of the happiest free-range chickens I've ever seen, and a mushroom hut, where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms. But this resort is also beautiful. Each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns, the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins, and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of Phang Nga Bay. The wooden decking leads to a private pool, but you can also pad down to the private sandy beach which stretches below and go for a swim. Fruit and drinks by the pool at Evason Six Senses Hideaway on Koh Yao Noi island . I ate poached rock lobster in coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime, and a beef curry on jasmine rice, at Six Senses' beautiful Hilltop restaurant before heading to the beach again where the hotel was screening the Hollywood classic Breakfast At Tiffany's under the stars. As I listened to Audrey Hepburn describe Tiffany, I thought that this hotel also was a great place to head to when you had the 'mean reds' – nothing very bad could happen to you here. Back at Sri Panwa and there was just enough time to indulge in one more Asian-style breakfast curry before take-off. I also spotted Norman lounging by his pool, so I wandered over to congratulate him on his set a few nights before. Norman merely shrugged, as if the crazed hero-worship in the club was just a run-of-the-mill Tuesday, so I duly toned down my enthusiasm and sauntered off with the look of 'Yeah, totally, I feel you. It's a normal Tuesday night in Phuket for me too.' And then it was back to London. I may have mislaid my zen in Phuket but I sure had partied. Indian Summers is out now on DVD.

Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier. The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine's once industrial heartland in ruins.

I've always had a love affair with Thailand. At the end of filming Channel 4's Indian Summers last year, I headed to Koh Phangan, an island off Ko Samui, and did a week-long meditation and yoga course. I came away convinced I was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in London – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on London Underground and from Sunday hangovers. So I jumped at the chance of heading out to Thailand again before the start of filming series two. Despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless Singapore Airlines, I arrived in Phuket still excited about recapturing my zen. Phuket, however, is very different from Koh Phangan. First of all it is much greener, and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones. I was staying at the luxurious Sri Panwa resort, which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out Enya, and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering Andaman Sea. Villa co-ordinator Pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort (a Thai princess and Liam from One Direction were there). I'm sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel's beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace, but when Pim dropped me off at my villa, she revealed that another famous Sri Panwa guest – DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) – was performing at a nightclub called Seduction that evening. I decided zen could wait. Seduction turned out to be off Bangla Road, the heart of Phuket's red-light district. Having grabbed a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel (complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out Taylor Swift's Blank Space), I arrived at Patong Beach itself. This is the strip is where zen goes to die. Olivia did yoga at Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa (pictured) Bangla Road in Phuket comes to life when the sun goes down. The road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights, loud music and cheap beer . There are Thai versions of cabaret clubs such as Crazy Horse and Moulin Rouge, while street hawkers sold tickets to 'ping-pong shows', which I later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded. Pim ushered me up an escalator to Seduction's rooftop party venue. Norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good-looking Thai crowd, all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an MA at Central Saint Martins in London, into a frenzy. The odd British tourist was in there too, looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below. The wife of one of the owners of Sri Panwa turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was 'VVIP'. Content in this knowledge, I continued my very English head-bob to Norman's hit song Praise You. The next morning, breakfast at Baba, Sri Panwa's poolside restaurant, was a glorious affair. I faced my greatest challenge so far… selecting from the breakfast buffet. Room with a view! The luxurious Sri Panwa resort in Phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the Andaman Sea . I always get a bit nervous at buffets. It has to be a carefully managed procedure, and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice, I did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a Thai fish curry. Curious but excellent is the only way I can describe this combination. It is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there. I caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that I can't really imagine at a breakfast buffet in London. I whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool, slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity, as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless I want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn. The James Bond Island is a popular feature in Phang Nga Bay, Phuket . I then headed up to Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa. Our Thai yoga instructor, who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany, performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from Couples Retreat, for anyone who knows that film. He didn't quite slap me on the bottom and say 'Encouragement', but it was a close-run thing. Then, after a fabulous dinner at Sri Panwa's beautifully appointed Thai restaurant Soul Food, where the 'squid on hot plate' sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for, I submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid. Returning to my quest for zen the next morning, I headed north of Phuket and took a 30-minute boat ride to a quiet island in Phang Nga Bay, which I had been advised was much less touristy than the Phi Phi islands made famous by the film adaptation of Alex Garland's The Beach. I was picked up by the staff of the Six Senses Yao Noi hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier, and was driven to the complex by a tuk-tuk, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in Phuket. DJ Hardwell also known as Fat Boy Slim,  performs a set. The DJ also stayed at the Sri Panwa and performed at a nightclub called seduction . The hotel is much more of a retreat than Sri Panwa and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly, sustainable resort. The landscaped gardens are supposedly 'edible', there's a space for some of the happiest free-range chickens I've ever seen, and a mushroom hut, where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms. But this resort is also beautiful. Each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns, the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins, and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of Phang Nga Bay. The wooden decking leads to a private pool, but you can also pad down to the private sandy beach which stretches below and go for a swim. Fruit and drinks by the pool at Evason Six Senses Hideaway on Koh Yao Noi island . I ate poached rock lobster in coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime, and a beef curry on jasmine rice, at Six Senses' beautiful Hilltop restaurant before heading to the beach again where the hotel was screening the Hollywood classic Breakfast At Tiffany's under the stars. As I listened to Audrey Hepburn describe Tiffany, I thought that this hotel also was a great place to head to when you had the 'mean reds' – nothing very bad could happen to you here. Back at Sri Panwa and there was just enough time to indulge in one more Asian-style breakfast curry before take-off. I also spotted Norman lounging by his pool, so I wandered over to congratulate him on his set a few nights before. Norman merely shrugged, as if the crazed hero-worship in the club was just a run-of-the-mill Tuesday, so I duly toned down my enthusiasm and sauntered off with the look of 'Yeah, totally, I feel you.

Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling and changed hands repeatedly throughout the conflict, with a small group of journalists. Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier.

Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period, while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes. The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed. Lysenko also reported civilian casualties, including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area, north of Donetsk. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky. The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin, spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday, but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting.

I've always had a love affair with Thailand. At the end of filming Channel 4's Indian Summers last year, I headed to Koh Phangan, an island off Ko Samui, and did a week-long meditation and yoga course. I came away convinced I was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in London – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on London Underground and from Sunday hangovers. So I jumped at the chance of heading out to Thailand again before the start of filming series two. Despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless Singapore Airlines, I arrived in Phuket still excited about recapturing my zen. Phuket, however, is very different from Koh Phangan. First of all it is much greener, and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones. I was staying at the luxurious Sri Panwa resort, which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out Enya, and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering Andaman Sea. Villa co-ordinator Pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort (a Thai princess and Liam from One Direction were there). I'm sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel's beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace, but when Pim dropped me off at my villa, she revealed that another famous Sri Panwa guest – DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) – was performing at a nightclub called Seduction that evening. I decided zen could wait. Seduction turned out to be off Bangla Road, the heart of Phuket's red-light district. Having grabbed a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel (complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out Taylor Swift's Blank Space), I arrived at Patong Beach itself. This is the strip is where zen goes to die. Olivia did yoga at Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa (pictured) Bangla Road in Phuket comes to life when the sun goes down. The road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights, loud music and cheap beer . There are Thai versions of cabaret clubs such as Crazy Horse and Moulin Rouge, while street hawkers sold tickets to 'ping-pong shows', which I later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded. Pim ushered me up an escalator to Seduction's rooftop party venue. Norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good-looking Thai crowd, all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an MA at Central Saint Martins in London, into a frenzy. The odd British tourist was in there too, looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below. The wife of one of the owners of Sri Panwa turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was 'VVIP'. Content in this knowledge, I continued my very English head-bob to Norman's hit song Praise You. The next morning, breakfast at Baba, Sri Panwa's poolside restaurant, was a glorious affair. I faced my greatest challenge so far… selecting from the breakfast buffet. Room with a view! The luxurious Sri Panwa resort in Phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the Andaman Sea . I always get a bit nervous at buffets. It has to be a carefully managed procedure, and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice, I did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a Thai fish curry. Curious but excellent is the only way I can describe this combination. It is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there. I caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that I can't really imagine at a breakfast buffet in London. I whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool, slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity, as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless I want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn. The James Bond Island is a popular feature in Phang Nga Bay, Phuket . I then headed up to Sri Panwa's Cool Spa, where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa. Our Thai yoga instructor, who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany, performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from Couples Retreat, for anyone who knows that film. He didn't quite slap me on the bottom and say 'Encouragement', but it was a close-run thing. Then, after a fabulous dinner at Sri Panwa's beautifully appointed Thai restaurant Soul Food, where the 'squid on hot plate' sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for, I submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid. Returning to my quest for zen the next morning, I headed north of Phuket and took a 30-minute boat ride to a quiet island in Phang Nga Bay, which I had been advised was much less touristy than the Phi Phi islands made famous by the film adaptation of Alex Garland's The Beach. I was picked up by the staff of the Six Senses Yao Noi hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier, and was driven to the complex by a tuk-tuk, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in Phuket.

But this resort is also beautiful. Each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns, the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins, and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of Phang Nga Bay.

Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period, while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes. The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed. Lysenko also reported civilian casualties, including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area, north of Donetsk. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky. The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin, spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday, but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting. 'The Russian-backed separatists continue to take aggressive action in Ukraine,' she said. 'And the Russian-backed separatists continue to stall Minsk implementation.",WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .Journalist at Russian TV channel step on landmine in east Ukraine .Andrei Lunev received serious head and lower extremities wounds .Six government troops and one rebel fighter dead after clashes overnight .,references

Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the £3.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think ""I want to be better than him"" or ""I am going to show him how good I am"". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for £1.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.","keeper has not played for the gunners since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton. but former arsenal goalkeeper says he will make a good change.

Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the £3.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think ""I want to be better than him"" or ""I am going to show him how good I am"". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for £1.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal?

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The  name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is 'likely' to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans.

The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them.

As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The  name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is 'likely' to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'.

In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is 'likely' to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch . This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express .",Fossils of a creature bearing a striking similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection .It is thought the fossil was found in Cromarty and would have once lived in a freshwater lake between 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago .Researchers have revealed that Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' - lived on the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness .,references

That was in 1970, at the end of a wonderfully hard-fought World Cup group match between England and Brazil, which the South Americans won 1-0. So loudly did the football world applaud such an exhibition of mutual respect between two giants of the game that all these decades later, the applause still resounds. That image of them is frequently flourished as a perfect example of what the game was, and is used to compare, unfavourably, with what it has become. Newcastle keeper Tim Krul  congratulated Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal at half-time . Bobby Moore's famous hug with Pele in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship . And so the Stadium of Light on Sunday afternoon. Tim Krul and Jermain Defoe are lesser stars than Moore and Pele, of course, and the Newcastle United goalkeeper's instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play. But was it really so different to that celebrated business in Guadalajara, Mexico, for which we don't only continue to congratulate the England colossus and the Brazilian legend for their integrity and values, but also ourselves, somehow, for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency? Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher, among many others, has lambasted Krul for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional. On Match of the Day 2, Danny Murphy agreed. The Dutchman, they say, was out of order. The implication is that, as he walked off the pitch at half-time, he should have been so lost in his own despair, or anger, or disappointment, or fierce resolve to get back on terms, that if he'd noticed Defoe at all, the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath, or at best a hard stare. Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports . Any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over, they reckon. Meanwhile, for some of Krul's critics on social media, the fact that it was an intense local derby puts his behaviour almost beyond the pale. How unutterably depressing. Has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro can't turn to another and say 'well played'? Nobody thinks that Krul would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards. But it was a wondrous strike, and, derby or not, half-time or not, a game that has no room either for an acknowledgment of a great piece of technique, or for a simple, impulsive act of sportsmanship, is a game that has become entirely detached from its roots. Defoe (left) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half-time to give Sunderland the lead against Newcastle . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . Others insist otherwise, saying only someone with 'no passion' for football could commend Krul for doing what he did. That's rubbish. I am a passionate Evertonian and naturally I have asked myself how I'd feel if, let's say, Tim Howard congratulated Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard in the tunnel after just being beaten by him, stupendously, from 30 yards. Would I consider it disrespectful to shell-shocked fans? Or assume that by so publicly fraternising with the 'enemy', Howard wasn't quite up for what remained of the fight? Of course not. On the contrary, I'd be pleased to have a grown-up on my team. Moreover, there is another dimension to all this. The sub-text in at least some of the excoriation of Krul's back-slapping is that he is one of the Premier League's foreign imports, and either doesn't fully understand the ferocious tribalism that flavours the Tyne-Wear derby, or being a highly-paid mercenary, chooses not to inhale it. Newcastle came up short against their rivals yet again, but Krul's gesture was not the problem . Defoe's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game, and congratulating him was the decent thing to do . But that's rubbish, too. Some of us might have wistfully fond memories of an age when English football was overwhelmingly populated by players from the British Isles, but we kid ourselves if we think that the modern domestic game is divided by passports into those who give their all and those who don't. And yet, let's be brutally honest, would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on Sunday, if it had been Defoe walking down the tunnel at half-time slapping Krul on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking, world-class save? In fact, would there have been any condemnation at all? Or would it have been held up as a heart-warming example, even in the intense heat of competition, of a typically honest English footballer doing the decent thing?","football's cricketing giants embraced as they were playing 1970. the hug was famous and a moment of great sportsmanship still resonates. it was at the end of the 1970 world cup group game. now, the image of football's two giants has become a myth.",t5_zeroshot

I am a passionate Evertonian and naturally I have asked myself how I'd feel if, let's say, Tim Howard congratulated Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard in the tunnel after just being beaten by him, stupendously, from 30 yards. Would I consider it disrespectful to shell-shocked fans? Or assume that by so publicly fraternising with the 'enemy', Howard wasn't quite up for what remained of the fight? Of course not. On the contrary, I'd be pleased to have a grown-up on my team. Moreover, there is another dimension to all this. The sub-text in at least some of the excoriation of Krul's back-slapping is that he is one of the Premier League's foreign imports, and either doesn't fully understand the ferocious tribalism that flavours the Tyne-Wear derby, or being a highly-paid mercenary, chooses not to inhale it. Newcastle came up short against their rivals yet again, but Krul's gesture was not the problem . Defoe's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game, and congratulating him was the decent thing to do . But that's rubbish, too. Some of us might have wistfully fond memories of an age when English football was overwhelmingly populated by players from the British Isles, but we kid ourselves if we think that the modern domestic game is divided by passports into those who give their all and those who don't. And yet, let's be brutally honest, would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on Sunday, if it had been Defoe walking down the tunnel at half-time slapping Krul on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking, world-class save?

That was in 1970, at the end of a wonderfully hard-fought World Cup group match between England and Brazil, which the South Americans won 1-0. So loudly did the football world applaud such an exhibition of mutual respect between two giants of the game that all these decades later, the applause still resounds. That image of them is frequently flourished as a perfect example of what the game was, and is used to compare, unfavourably, with what it has become. Newcastle keeper Tim Krul  congratulated Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal at half-time . Bobby Moore's famous hug with Pele in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship . And so the Stadium of Light on Sunday afternoon. Tim Krul and Jermain Defoe are lesser stars than Moore and Pele, of course, and the Newcastle United goalkeeper's instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play. But was it really so different to that celebrated business in Guadalajara, Mexico, for which we don't only continue to congratulate the England colossus and the Brazilian legend for their integrity and values, but also ourselves, somehow, for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency? Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher, among many others, has lambasted Krul for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional. On Match of the Day 2, Danny Murphy agreed. The Dutchman, they say, was out of order. The implication is that, as he walked off the pitch at half-time, he should have been so lost in his own despair, or anger, or disappointment, or fierce resolve to get back on terms, that if he'd noticed Defoe at all, the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath, or at best a hard stare. Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports . Any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over, they reckon. Meanwhile, for some of Krul's critics on social media, the fact that it was an intense local derby puts his behaviour almost beyond the pale. How unutterably depressing. Has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro can't turn to another and say 'well played'? Nobody thinks that Krul would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards. But it was a wondrous strike, and, derby or not, half-time or not, a game that has no room either for an acknowledgment of a great piece of technique, or for a simple, impulsive act of sportsmanship, is a game that has become entirely detached from its roots.

The tradition of Easter eggs can be traced back to the years following the First World War when the egg was adopted as a symbol of new life and hope. Prior to that chocolatiers had made chocolate fish, chickens and shoes at Easter because these were accepted symbols of the celebrations. Matchmakers look very different today! Now mostly associated with mint, back in 1991, a Matchmakers Easter Egg is retailed with 'Orange Chocolate Sticks' Very different from it's distinctive bold style today, a poster advertises Yorkie Easter in 1980.The Easter Egg can be traced back to WWI when eggs symbolised new life and hope . The new egg-shaped treats soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s but production stopped in the 1940s due to World War Two rationing. Shortages of key ingredients like sugar carried on until the early 1950s until British firm Rowntrees, now owned by Nestle, released their Dairy Egg in 1954. Since then chocolate Easter eggs have been a staple in households across the country. Alex Hutchinson, historian and archivist at Nestle, said: 'Prior to First World War people would celebrate Easter with chocolate fish and chickens which were symbols of the Christian story of Easter. Egg-cellent! Smarties Eggheads (pictured left) and Rowntree's Minty Eggs (pictured right) in 1991 show very different flavours to what is widely-known now. Rowntree's are characterised by their chewy Fruit Pastels . A Kit-Kat Easter egg poster from 1991 shows that the packaging hasn't changed dramatically to today, and has also maintained it's famous 'Have a Break!' tagline . Yorkie's Easter Egg poster from 1991, also shows that the chocolate has maintained its bold yellow and blue branding . 'We also made chocolate shoes, which were pagan symbols of a tradition in the north of England whereby people would buy new shoes and bonnets to wear to church at Easter. 'After the First World War we reintroduced the Easter egg in 1922. The eggs symbolised the spring, new life and hope. 'Easter eggs became hugely popular and the rest is history. 'We put together this archive of photos as a little Easter treat for fans of Easter eggs. 'Our archives go all the way back to the very beginning of the chocolate Easter egg but this selection of images focuses on the 70s, 80s and 90s because the designs and packaging are much cooler. 'A little bit of nostalgia is great fun, and there's bound to be a few eggs in there that people remember from their childhoods.' Retro egg!

But can a woman with 34G curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress? SECRET SUPPORT . Lace pencil dress, £169, Monsoon.co.uk . Blue caged heels, £39.99, Zara.com . I would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than I am. This one manages the impossible. The narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs, making me look taller and slimmer, and the bustline is quite high, hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look. What I really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem, which softens the silhouette. But while looking summery, the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support, boosted by the Chantelle strapless bra I wear underneath all the dresses. Great for summer weddings. 4/5 . ONE FOR TEENS . Prom-style dress, £58.99, Chichiclothing.com . Gold sandals, £34,99, newlook.com . This might look lovely on a teenage girl, but on me — eek! At 48 I'm at least 30 years too old to carry it off. The material is flimsy and there's almost no structure, so my bust looks horribly saggy. And the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as I am on top — not a good look. Forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare. 1/5 . FLATTERING AND COMFY . Floral maxi dress, £72, Asos.com . The large, floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect. It distracts the eye which instantly slims you. This is a relaxed, 1970s style, so anything too fitted would look out of place. The best thing is how comfortable it feels. You could wear it anywhere — to the beach, to a garden party, or to an evening do. A winner, and at a great price, too. 5/5 . SHORT... BUT NOT SWEET . Mini dress, £45, Riverisland.com; Strap-heeled sandals, £39.99, Zara.com . This clings well and gives me a neat waistline. The bandeau-style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down. But below the waist it's a different story. Quite frankly, the skirt is far too short. I've always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs: doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking. I'd have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer. 2/5 . OSCAR WORTHY . Double layer maxi dress, £110, Jarlolondon.co.uk . This clever design has a double layer: the lining clings tightly, but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette. The overall look is statuesque and Grecian. The vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan. In it, I feel like Cameron Diaz going up for an Oscar. I'm ready for my close-up. 5/5 . I LOOK SO SLIM . Sweetheart neckline dress, £150, Coast-stores.com; Heels. £485, biondacastana.com . This sophisticated little summery frock has a sweetheart neckline, which curves down to show a bit of cleavage and then rises up to cover the breasts on either side, striking the perfect balance between flirtiness and discretion. As well as being flattering, the bodice is structured and well-made, minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it's needed — there's no way I'll be falling out of this frock. The clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect, slimming down my bottom and hips, and falling flatteringly below the knee. I can certainly imagine myself going to a summer wedding in this little green number. 4/5 .",": A strapless dress is a red carpet staple for fine-boned actresses such as Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow.

As well as being flattering, the bodice is structured and well-made, minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it's needed — there's no way I'll be falling out of this frock. The clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect, slimming down my bottom and hips, and falling flatteringly below the knee.

But can a woman with 34G curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress? SECRET SUPPORT . Lace pencil dress, £169, Monsoon.co.uk . Blue caged heels, £39.99, Zara.com . I would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than I am. This one manages the impossible. The narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs, making me look taller and slimmer, and the bustline is quite high, hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look. What I really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem, which softens the silhouette. But while looking summery, the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support, boosted by the Chantelle strapless bra I wear underneath all the dresses. Great for summer weddings. 4/5 . ONE FOR TEENS . Prom-style dress, £58.99, Chichiclothing.com . Gold sandals, £34,99, newlook.com . This might look lovely on a teenage girl, but on me — eek! At 48 I'm at least 30 years too old to carry it off. The material is flimsy and there's almost no structure, so my bust looks horribly saggy. And the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as I am on top — not a good look. Forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare. 1/5 . FLATTERING AND COMFY . Floral maxi dress, £72, Asos.com . The large, floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect. It distracts the eye which instantly slims you. This is a relaxed, 1970s style, so anything too fitted would look out of place. The best thing is how comfortable it feels. You could wear it anywhere — to the beach, to a garden party, or to an evening do. A winner, and at a great price, too. 5/5 . SHORT... BUT NOT SWEET . Mini dress, £45, Riverisland.com; Strap-heeled sandals, £39.99, Zara.com . This clings well and gives me a neat waistline. The bandeau-style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down. But below the waist it's a different story. Quite frankly, the skirt is far too short. I've always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs: doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking. I'd have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer. 2/5 . OSCAR WORTHY . Double layer maxi dress, £110, Jarlolondon.co.uk . This clever design has a double layer: the lining clings tightly, but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette. The overall look is statuesque and Grecian. The vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan. In it, I feel like Cameron Diaz going up for an Oscar. I'm ready for my close-up. 5/5 .
