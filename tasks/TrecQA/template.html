            <h1>Question Answering</h1>
            <p>You will be shown a question and several sentences that possibly answer the question.  Please judge  whether or not each of the sentences contains an answer to the question.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To the right of each question we give a hint - a short phrase that is one possible correct answer.  This is not the only correct answer.</li>
                <li>The questions and sentences were created several years ago, so they may no longer be true.  You should still answer them as correct, if the text of the sentence gives a good answer that was true at that time.</li>
                <li>You do not need to look up whether each answer is correct.  Just say whether the sentence is a possible answer for the question.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is one example:</p>

            <p><u><b>Notes:</b></u></p>
            <p><i>This was true in the past</i></p>
            Even though Cruise is not married to Kidman anymore, it was true in the past. Thus as long as the sentence suggests such a "fact", you should click the "Yes" button.             You'll see other similar examples in the HIT, such as asking whom the president of the U.S. is, and the answer is not necessarily Obama.             <br />
            <p><i>The possible answer is just a hint!</i></p>
            For each question, we provide some possible answers to help you. However, a sentence containing a hint <i>doesn't always mean it is a good answer</i> to the question.             For instance, sentence 1 above mentions Nicole Kidman, but it only suggests that Cruise and Kidman played a married couple in a movie (not real life), thus it does not answer the original question.</td>
