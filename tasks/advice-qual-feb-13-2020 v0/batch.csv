I think, if the girlfriend really cares about her boyfriend, she should just be supportive for the time being and let the boyfriend continue to sort thru his feelings.

One nitpick; in the examples, the second one, you have slightly a, because b mentions ""the kids"". But, that's the _point_ of that question: That the asker wants to have kids, and the guy doesn't seem to. So, ""the kids"" read to me, ""Is it that he doesn't actually want to have kids, and you do, and that's why he hasn't proposed?"".  At least, that was my parse. Then, example three, A is responding to the fact that the question-asker feels they were fired unjustly (hence lost wages and unemployment), and the police report is because there is potentially criminal negligence!  Additionally, there are sometimes criminal penalties (intimidation maybe?) for retaliatory firing a whisteblower.  So advice A made perfect sense, while B, though thorough, is so much less useful: The question asker doesn't give a hoot about the safety of other people, they cared about their own safety, while at the job. The whole unsafe conditions was merely a prelude for the asker to justify their statement that they were ""fired for no reason"".I'd justify my other answers (I can! Like, the first one, how 'B' doesn't actually seem to get the asker's problem is the lack of monogamy) but since you say there's ""no need"", bleh. (That last one... I could have gone less harsh, but Advice A is completely bogus. How does the asker ""make sure he's comfortable with who he choose to tell""? and she's already ""let him know that you're there to listen""; all of 'A' seems completely useless to the asker...)So, I'm sure I bombed, given this is super duper subjective and how I disagreed completely with the examples... hopefully you'll at least have some feedback on it, or maybe considering the subjectiveness and care about people wanting to do it correctly...  Depending on what your research is, perhaps you'd consider adding inputs for the questions to allow people to justify decisions if they feel it's warranted.  I have a feeling you've never had the pleasure of working for a business where calling the police really was the sanest option... ;P",1a,helpful,meaning,2b,nothelpful,neutral,2b,nothelpful,contradiction,1391.34
