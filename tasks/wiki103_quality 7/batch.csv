Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed, or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination. Yet his fascination was all-consuming and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for almost two decades; an examination and homage described as ""without parallel in the history of art "". Bacon's approach differs to Velázquez's in a number of ways: both artists were expressive, yet Bacon's broad brush-strokes and freedom with paint contrast with Velázquez's tight and controlled treatment. He adapts Velázquez's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer's point of view, elevating and distancing him. This was already a common technique in commercial, promotional photography but in Bacon's hands, Schmied argues, the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe.",unlikelihood_beam.json,2,8.954,{},2,2,,

The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a"" façade for suburban success "". Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams'home, where they signify ""a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality "". Carolyn feels that"" as long as there can be roses, all is well "". She cuts the roses and puts them in vases, where they adorn her ""meretricious vision of what makes for beauty"" and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot.

<formula>=
""<formula>"" is a colloquial form of the Greek word <unk>. It is often used as a synonym for a noun or a verb, but in fact is a synonym only in the sense that it does not have the same meaning as the noun itself. In Greek, ""<formula"" is an adjective, not a noun; in English, ""<unk>"" is a verb.
<formula> is","instructus ""(a man notable for his prudence, devotion and learning). These qualities were displayed in the two surviving manuscripts of his riddles and four of his Ars Tatuini. The Ars is one of only two surviving 8th-century Latin grammars from England, and was based on the works of Priscian and Consentius. The riddles deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity, the five senses and the alphabet, and a book and a pen. The riddles are formed in acrostics. The grammar is a reworking of Donatus's Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammarians. It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language, but is designed for more advanced students. It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars, although not directly but through other grammatical works. There are also some examples drawn from the Psalms. The work was completed before he became archbishop, and was used not only in England but also on the continent. A recent edition of his works is Tatuini Opera omnia, published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin.",unlikelihood_beam.json,1,143.024,{},3,2,,

The route was divided into three sections, each of which was designated by a different number of times.
